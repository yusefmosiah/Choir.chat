# Core Client-Side Implementation

## Overview

Implement the foundational client-side system that enables AI processing via Anthropic and OpenAI APIs, SUI blockchain integration, and the carousel UI for the Chorus Cycle. Focus on creating a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates key features while preparing for future integration with Liquid AI's Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs).

## Tasks

### 1. AI Processing via APIs

- **Integrate Anthropic and OpenAI APIs**

  - Set up API clients for Anthropic and OpenAI.
  - Implement functions to send prompts and receive responses.
  - Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully.

- **Prepare for Future LFM Integration**
  - Design the architecture to allow easy switching from API-based models to local LFMs.
  - Abstract AI processing logic to accommodate different model sources.

### 2. SUI Wallet Integration

- **Integrate SUIKit for Blockchain Interactions**
  - Implement wallet creation, import, and transaction signing within the app.
  - Facilitate user authentication via SUI wallet.

### 3. Carousel UI Implementation

- **Develop Carousel UI Pattern**
  - Create a carousel interface for navigating through Chorus Cycle phases.
  - Ensure adjacent phase previews are visible for a typographic, newspaper-like design.

### 4. Proxy Authentication Setup

- **Set Up Secure API Proxy**
  - Deploy a server-side proxy to handle AI API requests securely.
  - Implement SUI-signed token authentication for proxy access.

### 5. Initial Testing

- **Conduct Initial Integration Tests**
  - Verify AI API integrations.
  - Test SUI wallet functionalities.
  - Ensure carousel UI navigates smoothly between phases.

## Success Criteria

- **Functional MVP**

  - Users can authenticate with their SUI wallet.
  - Users can input messages and navigate through the Chorus Cycle using the carousel UI.
  - AI responses are fetched and displayed correctly via Anthropic and OpenAI APIs.

- **Secure Operations**

  - Proxy server securely handles API requests and authentication.
  - API keys remain protected on the server side.

- **Scalable Architecture**
  - The system is designed to switch to Liquid AI's LFMs with minimal changes.
  - Codebase follows best practices for scalability and maintainability.

## Future Considerations

- **Liquid AI LFMs Integration**
  - Once access is granted, integrate LFMs for on-device AI processing.
  - Optimize the architecture to transition from API-based to local model-based processing seamlessly.
