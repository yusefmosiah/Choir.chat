## Description

Implement local data storage and synchronization using SwiftData, managing users, threads, and messages effectively. This ensures data persistence and offline access while preparing for future synchronization with the SUI blockchain.

## Tasks

### 1. Define SwiftData Models

- **Create Models for `User`, `Thread`, and `Message`**

  - Ensure appropriate relationships and data integrity.
  - Support offline access and local data persistence.

- **Implement Data Relationships**
  - Define one-to-many and many-to-many relationships as needed.
  - Ensure models align with blockchain ownership data.

### 2. Implement Data Operations

- **CRUD Operations for Threads and Messages**

  - Implement create, read, update, and delete functionalities.
  - Ensure smooth user interactions and data consistency.

- **Handle Data Consistency and Conflict Resolution**
  - Develop mechanisms to resolve data conflicts between local and blockchain data.
  - Implement versioning or timestamps to manage updates.

### 3. Prepare for Future Synchronization

- **Design Synchronization Logic**

  - Outline how local data will sync with on-chain data.
  - Plan for data reconciliation and conflict handling.

- **Implement Initial Sync Mechanism**
  - Develop basic synchronization between local data and blockchain state.
  - Test synchronization with sample data.

## Success Criteria

- **Reliable Local Storage**

  - Users can create and manage threads and messages locally.
  - Data persists across app launches and device restarts.

- **Efficient Data Handling**

  - CRUD operations perform smoothly without lag.
  - Data relationships are maintained accurately.

- **Preparation for Blockchain Synchronization**
  - Architecture supports future data synchronization.
  - Initial sync tests are successful, laying the groundwork for full integration.

## Future Considerations

- **SUI Blockchain Synchronization**

  - Implement full data synchronization with the SUI blockchain.
  - Ensure real-time updates and consistency between local and on-chain data.

- **Advanced Conflict Resolution**
  - Develop sophisticated methods to handle complex data conflicts.
  - Implement user prompts or automated resolutions where appropriate.
