## Description

Integrate the CHOIR token within the app, enabling staking, rewards distribution, and token transactions in line with the economic model. This involves setting up the token mechanics through smart contracts and ensuring seamless user interactions with tokens.

## Tasks

### 1. Token Mechanics Implementation

- **Display Token Balances**

  - Show users their CHOIR token balances within the app.
  - Include both wallet balance and staked amounts.

- **Implement Staking Functionality**

  - Allow users to stake tokens when participating in threads.
  - Enable staking amounts to vary based on thread temperature or frequency.

- **Reward Distribution**
  - Distribute rewards based on user contributions and participation.
  - Implement automated reward calculations tied to the quantum harmonic oscillator model.

### 2. User Interface Enhancements

- **Rewards Dashboard**

  - Create a dashboard displaying earned rewards.
  - Visualize performance and progress in token accumulation.

- **Staking Actions**

  - Include UI elements for staking and unstaking tokens.
  - Guide users through the staking process with clear instructions.

- **Transaction History**
  - Provide a ledger of token transactions.
  - Enhance transparency and user trust.

### 3. Education and Compliance

- **In-App Explanations**

  - Include explanations of token mechanics within the app.
  - Educate users on staking, rewards, and token usage.

- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - Ensure the tokenomics align with relevant financial and data protection regulations.
  - Implement necessary measures for compliance.

## Success Criteria

- **Seamless Token Integration**

  - Users can view, stake, and manage their CHOIR tokens effortlessly.
  - Token transactions are processed correctly and securely via the blockchain.

- **Aligned Economic Model**

  - Tokenomics reflect the documented economic principles of the platform.
  - Rewards distribution is fair and incentivizes desired user behaviors.

- **User Education**
  - Users understand how the token system works through in-app resources.
  - Compliance with regulations is maintained to avoid legal issues.

## Future Considerations

- **Advanced Token Features**

  - Explore decentralized governance models using CHOIR tokens.
  - Implement additional token utilities as the platform evolves.

- **Dynamic Reward Systems**
  - Adapt reward mechanisms based on user feedback and platform needs.
  - Introduce tiered rewards or bonuses for high contributors.
