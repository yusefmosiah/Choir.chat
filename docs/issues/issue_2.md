## Description

Implement SUI blockchain integration using SUIKit for secure user authentication, thread ownership, and message verification. Focus on establishing the foundational blockchain interactions while maintaining secure key management.

## Tasks

### 1. SUIKit Integration

- **Add SUIKit Package**
  ```swift
  // Package.swift
  dependencies: [
      .package(url: "https://github.com/OpenDive/SuiKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.2.2"))
  ]
  ```
- Configure providers for testnet/mainnet
- Implement basic wallet operations

### 2. Key Management

- **Implement Secure Key Storage**

  ```swift
  class KeyManager {
      private let keychain = KeychainService()

      func storeKeys(_ wallet: Wallet) throws {
          try keychain.save(wallet.privateKey, forKey: "sui_private_key")
          try keychain.save(wallet.publicKey, forKey: "sui_public_key")
      }
  }
  ```

- Use Keychain for private key storage
- Handle key import/export securely

### 3. User Authentication

- Implement wallet-based authentication
- Create user profiles linked to SUI addresses
- Handle session management

### 4. Thread Ownership

- Design thread ownership smart contract
- Implement thread creation/transfer
- Handle co-author permissions

## Success Criteria

- Secure key management
- Reliable blockchain interactions
- Clean integration with SwiftData
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Considerations

- Advanced smart contract features
- Multi-device key sync
- Enhanced permission models
