# PostChain UI Refactor Checklist: Turn-Based Horizontal Navigation

## Overview
Complete architectural change from vertical page navigation to horizontal turn-based navigation.

**Current Problem**:
- Vertical navigation between separate pages (User Message ‚Üï AI Response)
- Horizontal TabView navigation between AI phases (Action ‚Üî Experience ‚Üî IOU ‚Üî Yield)
- Inconsistent behavior: new threads show no phase navigation, old threads show horizontal phase tabs

**New Goal**:
- **Turn-based architecture**: Each turn contains 5 vertical pages
- **Horizontal navigation**: Between conversation turns (Turn 1 ‚Üî Turn 2 ‚Üî Turn 3)
- **Vertical navigation**: Within each turn between 5 pages:
  1. User Prompt Page
  2. Action Page
  3. Experience Page (with collapsible sections for vectors + web)
  4. IOU Page (with collapsible sections for intention + observation + understanding)
  5. Yield Page
- **Auto-advance**: Pages automatically advance when content loads
- **Manual navigation**: Users can swipe up/down between pages within a turn anytime
- **Full-screen pages**: Each page takes full screen, scrolls if content is taller

## Phase 1: Understand Current Architecture Issues

### üîç **Current Architecture Problems:**
1. **ConversationPageView**: Creates separate pages for User Message and AI Response
2. **PageNavigationController**: Handles VERTICAL navigation (up/down) between pages
3. **AIResponsePageView**: Uses TabView for HORIZONTAL navigation between phases
4. **Inconsistent behavior**: New threads (1 phase) vs old threads (multiple phases)

### üéØ **Target Architecture:**
1. **TurnContainer**: Each turn contains 5 vertical pages with horizontal turn navigation
2. **HorizontalTurnController**: Handles navigation between turns (left/right)
3. **VerticalPageController**: Handles navigation within turn pages (up/down)
4. **Auto-advance logic**: Pages advance automatically when content loads
5. **Collapsible sections**: Experience and IOU pages have expandable content sections

## Phase 2: Create New Turn-Based Components

### ‚úÖ **New Components to Create:**

#### 2.1 Turn Container View
- [ ] `TurnContainerView.swift` - Container for one complete conversation turn

## NEW ARCHITECTURE: Turn-Based Hybrid Navigation

### üéØ **Updated Goal (Hybrid Architecture):**
- **Horizontal navigation**: Between conversation turns (Turn 1 ‚Üî Turn 2 ‚Üî Turn 3)
- **Vertical navigation**: Within each turn between 5 full-screen pages:
  1. User Prompt Page
  2. Action Page
  3. Experience Page (with collapsible sections for vectors + web)
  4. IOU Page (with collapsible sections for intention + observation + understanding)
  5. Yield Page
- **Auto-advance**: Pages automatically advance when content loads
- **Manual navigation**: Users can swipe up/down between pages within a turn anytime
- **Full-screen pages**: Each page takes full screen, scrolls if content is taller

### üöÄ **Implementation Plan:**

#### Step 1: Create TurnContainerView
- [x] Create `TurnContainerView.swift` with 5-page vertical navigation
- [x] Integrate existing page views: User ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Experience ‚Üí IOU ‚Üí Yield
- [x] Add auto-advance logic for content loading
- [x] Fix compilation errors and main actor isolation issues

#### Step 2: Create HorizontalTurnController
- [x] Create `HorizontalTurnController.swift` for turn-to-turn navigation
- [x] Replace `ConversationPageView` usage with new controller
- [x] Group messages into conversation turns (user message + AI response = 1 turn)
- [x] Fix CGSize property access issues (width instead of x)

#### Step 3: Auto-Advance Integration
- [x] Create `TurnAutoAdvanceManager.swift`
- [x] Monitor streaming content completion for each phase
- [x] Auto-advance to next page when content loads
- [x] Handle user manual navigation overrides (don't auto-advance if user went back)
- [x] Fix main actor isolation issues for SwiftUI integration

#### Step 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Build and test compilation
- [ ] Test with old threads (multiple completed phases)
- [ ] Test with new threads (streaming content)
- [ ] Test manual navigation during streaming
- [ ] Test horizontal turn navigation between conversation turns
- [ ] Test vertical page navigation within turns
- [ ] Test auto-advance functionality
- [ ] Polish animations and transitions
- [ ] Performance optimization for large conversations

## Notes

- **This is a hybrid architecture** - horizontal turns + vertical pages within turns
- **Auto-advance is key** - pages should advance as content loads, but allow manual override
- **Maintain existing page views** - enhance with collapsible sections, don't rebuild from scratch
- **Test frequently** - this touches core conversation functionality
- **Focus on user experience** - smooth animations and responsive gestures are critical
