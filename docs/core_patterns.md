# Core Implementation Patterns

VERSION core_patterns: 6.0

The implementation patterns form a cohesive framework for building reliable distributed systems. These patterns ensure clear sources of truth, coordinate state changes through events, and maintain proper actor isolation throughout the system.

The Source of Truth pattern establishes a clear data authority hierarchy. The blockchain serves as the ultimate arbiter of economic state, managing thread states and token balances through an authoritative interface. Vector stores maintain authority over content and semantic relationships, handling message storage and citation recording. This separation of concerns ensures that each subsystem has clear responsibility for its domain.

Event Coordination weaves the system together through carefully typed events. State synchronization flows through chain state and content storage events. UI coordination happens through view state and loading state updates. Error handling maintains system stability through typed error events and sync failure notifications. This event-driven architecture enables loose coupling while maintaining system coherence.

Actor Isolation creates clean boundaries between system components. Domain-specific actors encapsulate their state and behavior, communicating through well-defined interfaces. Resource management follows structured patterns for acquisition and release, ensuring proper cleanup even under failure conditions. This isolation enables concurrent processing while preventing data races and state corruption.

Error Recovery builds resilience into the system through typed error handling. The system categorizes errors by their source - chain errors, vector errors, and synchronization failures. Recovery strategies adapt to each error type, implementing appropriate retry logic, state resynchronization, and cleanup procedures. This layered approach to error handling maintains system stability even under adverse conditions.

Testing follows a protocol-based approach that enables thorough verification of system behavior. Mock implementations of core protocols allow testing of individual components in isolation. Test scenarios cover the full range of system operations, from basic state synchronization to complex error recovery paths. This comprehensive testing strategy ensures reliable system operation.

The implementation's strength emerges from several key aspects. Source of truth clarity flows from the chain state's authority over economic data and vector stores' mastery of content, creating clean hierarchical data flows and proper state transitions. Event-driven coordination manifests through typed system events, synchronized state changes, coordinated UI patterns, and clear error propagation paths.

Actor isolation maintains system integrity through well-defined domain boundaries and careful resource management. This enables clean concurrent processing while ensuring proper state encapsulation. Error resilience builds from typed error handling through sophisticated recovery strategies and retry mechanisms, culminating in proper state cleanup procedures.

The testing approach ensures system reliability through comprehensive verification. Protocol-based mocking enables isolated component testing, while thorough scenarios verify behavior across the full system. This multi-layered testing strategy catches issues early while ensuring proper integration.

Through these carefully crafted patterns, the system achieves several critical qualities. Each component maintains clear authority over its domain, while state changes flow naturally through the event system. Components operate independently without interference, and the system recovers gracefully from failures. Most importantly, thorough testing verifies behavior at all levels.

This pattern language creates a foundation for building reliable, maintainable, and evolvable distributed systems. The patterns work together harmoniously, enabling the construction of robust systems that can grow and adapt while maintaining fundamental stability and reliability.
