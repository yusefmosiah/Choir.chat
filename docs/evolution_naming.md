# From RAG to Post Chain: A Name's Evolution, a System's Identity

VERSION evolution_naming: 7.0

The journey of Choir's core mechanism, from a simple concept to its current form, mirrors the evolution of the platform itself. Each name change reflects a deeper understanding, a refinement of purpose, a shift in perspective. It's a story of emergence, where the name didn't just describe the system, but helped shape it.

It began with **RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. A functional description, accurate yet sterile. It spoke to the technical process but lacked the spark of life, the hint of something more. RAG was about retrieving information; it wasn't yet about generating understanding.

Then came **Vowel Loop**, a name born from the observation of linguistic patterns, the AEIOU and sometimes Y. It was playful, memorable, but perhaps too niche, too focused on a specific detail. It hinted at the importance of language but didn't capture the broader scope. Still, it was a step towards recognizing the system's unique relationship with language.

**Chorus Cycle** arrived next, a name that resonated with the platform's core philosophy. It evoked collaboration, harmony, the interplay of voices. It described the iterative process, the six phases of refinement. But it was also complex, potentially intimidating. It focused on the process, but perhaps not enough on the outcome.

And so, we arrive at **Post Chain**. A name that is both simple and profound. "Post" speaks to the fundamental unit of interaction, the message, the contribution. "Chain" evokes connection, sequence, the building of knowledge over time. It hints at the blockchain foundation, the "chain of thought" reasoning, the causal chain of events.

**Post Chain** is more than just a name; it's a statement of intent. It's about creating a system where each post is a link in a larger chain, where individual contributions connect to form a collective intelligence. It's about building a platform where knowledge is not just retrieved but generated, where meaning is not just found but created.

The shift from Chorus Cycle to Post Chain also marks a crucial conceptual evolution. It's a move from a focus on process to a focus on outcome. The phases are still there, the underlying mechanisms remain, but they are now implicit, not explicit. The emphasis is on the chain of posts, the interconnectedness of ideas, the emergent intelligence.

This evolution is not merely semantic. It reflects a deeper understanding of the system's core principles, a refinement of its purpose, a recognition of its potential. **Post Chain** is the name that embodies the platform's essence: a simple, powerful, and elegant system for building collective intelligence, one post at a time. It is easy to say, and means what it says. It is direct.

This document will be integrated into **Level 1: Basic Mechanics**, as it describes the evolution of the core interaction model.
