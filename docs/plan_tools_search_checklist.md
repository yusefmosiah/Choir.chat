# üîß Tool Integration Implementation Plan

## üéØ Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementation
2. **Incremental Integration** - Start with simple tools, then advance to complex ones
3. **Dual Testing Approach** - Test tools both standalone and in multimodel chat threads
4. **Minimal Dependencies** - Keep implementations as simple as possible
5. **Clear Interfaces** - Define consistent tool interfaces

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

We are currently using a temporary architecture while we iterate on tool implementations:

1. **Current Implementation**: Uses a `ConversationWithTools` wrapper class (`app/tools/conversation.py`) that:

   - Manages conversation state
   - Extracts tool calls using regex
   - Executes tools and manages message history
   - Handles model-specific formatting needs (especially for Mistral models)

2. **Known Limitations**:

   - Duplicates logic that could be in `abstract_llm_completion_stream`
   - Uses regex-based extraction rather than structured tool calling
   - Not integrated with the core Post Chain architecture
   - Different model providers have inconsistent tool calling formats

3. **Future Direction**:
   - Integrate tool support directly into `abstract_llm_completion_stream`
   - Use LangGraph for proper state management in the Post Chain
   - Standardize the tool calling interface across providers

For now, we'll continue with the current approach to make rapid progress, while documenting areas for future improvement.

- [x] Added exponential backoff for rate limit handling (Brave Search)
- [x] Improved error handling for all providers
- [x] Added retry logic with configurable attempts
- [ ] Implement request caching to reduce API usage

#### Search Provider Reliability Assessment

Based on extensive testing, here's our assessment of search providers:

1. **Brave Search**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

   - Most reliable provider in our testing
   - High-quality results with official API
   - Rate limits can be an issue (1 request/second on free tier)
   - Successfully implemented exponential backoff to handle rate limits
   - Now configured as our default primary provider

2. **Tavily Search**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

   - AI-optimized search, but inconsistent reliability
   - Frequent "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" JSON parsing errors
   - Good result quality when working
   - Moved to first fallback position due to reliability issues

3. **DuckDuckGo Search**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
   - No API key required, good for development
   - Frequent rate limit errors (202 Ratelimit)
   - "unsupported value" errors with different backends
   - Used as last resort fallback

Our current strategy ensures maximum reliability by starting with the most consistent provider and falling back as needed. Exponential backoff and retry logic has significantly improved overall search reliability.

#### Web Search Integration Tests

- [x] Create test for web search in multimodel chat thread
- [x] Test different query types and result handling
- [x] Verify context maintenance with search results
- [x] Test search provider fallback
- [x] Document integration patterns

- [x] Add usage guidance in search results for events after model training cutoff
- [x] Test handling of search results about "future" events relative to model training
- [x] Document best practices for prompting models with recent events

#### LangGraph Provider Compatibility

- [x] Test web search tool with different providers in LangGraph
- [x] Document provider-specific compatibility issues
- [x] Identify best-performing models for tool usage
- [x] Create detailed test reports for each provider/model

#### Message Format Standardization

- [x] Identify provider-specific message format requirements
- [x] Enhance `convert_to_langchain_messages` function for multi-provider compatibility
- [x] Fix empty content handling for Anthropic models
- [x] Implement special formatting for Google Gemini models
- [x] Add proper tool message conversion for Mistral models
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite for message format conversion
- [x] Verify compatibility across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and Groq

#### Provider-Specific Format Handling

Our improvements to the `convert_to_langchain_messages` function addressed several key issues:

1. **Empty Content Handling**:

   - Fixed issues with Anthropic models rejecting empty content messages
   - Ensured Google Gemini messages use a space instead of empty string
   - Properly handled message sequence constraints for Mistral models

2. **Tool Message Conversion**:

   - Enhanced conversion of tool calls and results across providers
   - Implemented proper extraction of tool name and tool_call_id
   - Created deep copies to prevent side effects during message manipulation

3. **Special Case Processing**:
   - Added special handling for Google Gemini when only system messages are present
   - Implemented proper conversion for Mistral when assistant messages would be last in sequence

These improvements have significantly enhanced cross-provider compatibility, allowing us to use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Groq in the same conversation with consistent tool usage. Testing confirms these changes have reduced API errors and improved the reliability of multi-model conversations with tools.

##### Comprehensive List of Models with Working Tool Support

Based on our extensive testing, the following models successfully work with tool usage:

**OpenAI Models:**

- o1
- o3-mini
- gpt-4o-mini

**Anthropic Models:**

- Claude-3.7-Sonnet
- Claude-3.5-Haiku

**Google Models:**

- gemini-2.0-flash

**Mistral Models:**

- mistral-small-latest
- mistral-large-latest
- pixtral-12b-2409
- pixtral-large-latest
- codestral-latest

**Fireworks Models:**

- deepseek-v3

**Groq Models:**

- qwen-qwq-32b
- deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b

These models successfully:

1. Make appropriate tool calls when presented with queries requiring external information
2. Process tool responses correctly
3. Incorporate tool-provided information into their final responses
4. Return accurate information based on tool results

When implementing tool support in production, we recommend prioritizing models from Anthropic and Mistral for their 100% success rates, followed by selected OpenAI models. For cost-sensitive applications, Mistral's models provide an excellent balance of reliability and performance.

##### Updated Implementation Recommendations

- **For Production**: Use Anthropic or Mistral models for most reliable tool usage; OpenAI's o1, o3-mini, or gpt-4o-mini as alternatives
- **Most Accurate**: Anthropic models maintain their 100% success rate, with Mistral models close behind
- **Best Performance/Cost**: Mistral's large models and smaller OpenAI models offer good balance of reliability and cost
- **Custom Implementations**: Maintain provider-specific implementations for Cohere and providers with inconsistent tool support
- **Message Format Handling**: Standardized message conversion now handles provider-specific requirements automatically
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for rate limits, API failures, and service unavailable errors
- **Fallback Strategy**: Implemented provider detection and appropriate message formatting for each model provider
- **Search Provider**: Use Brave Search as primary provider with fallback to Tavily and DuckDuckGo
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff with retry logic successfully implemented for Brave Search

##### Next Steps for Tool Integration

- Enhance unified tool interface to handle further provider-specific requirements
- Continue refining message format handling for emerging models and providers
- Implement automatic fallback mechanisms for models that don't support function calling
- Add rate limit handling with exponential backoff for additional providers
- Develop robust error handling for API failures and service outages
- Continue testing emerging models and updating compatibility matrix
- Implement monitoring for tool usage success rates across different providers

##### In-Depth Analysis of Successful Tool Usage

Based on the examination of test reports from successful models, we've identified several key factors that contribute to effective tool usage:

1. **Tool Call Format Consistency**: Successful models like Mistral and Groq's `qwen-qwq-32b` consistently format their tool calls in a way that matches the expected OpenAI function calling format.

2. **Query Refinement**: Top-performing models often refine the user's query to create more focused search terms (e.g., "Super Bowl LIX 2025 winner final score" instead of the original query) which leads to more relevant results.

3. **Response Quality**: Successful models not only use the tools correctly but also synthesize the information into coherent, accurate responses that directly answer the user's question.

4. **Error Resilience**: Models that handle search provider errors gracefully (falling back to alternative providers) show better overall performance.

5. **Tool Selection Intelligence**: Many failures stem from models not even attempting to use tools. This suggests we need better tool selection prompting or fallback approaches for these models.

For implementation, we should ensure our tool interface handles these variations by:

- Normalizing tool call formats across different providers
- Providing clear instructions about when and how to use tools
- Implementing fallback mechanisms for models that don't make tool calls
- Monitoring and handling rate limits and API errors proactively

## üìù Testing Frameworks

### Calculator Test Framework

```python
def test_calculator_basic():
    """Test basic calculator operations"""
    calculator = CalculatorTool()

    # Test addition
    assert calculator.calculate("2 + 2") == 4

    # Test subtraction
    assert calculator.calculate("10 - 5") == 5

    # Test multiplication
    assert calculator.calculate("3 * 4") == 12

    # Test division
    assert calculator.calculate("20 / 5") == 4
```

### Calculator Integration Test

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_calculator_in_multimodel_thread():
    """Test calculator tool in a multimodel conversation thread"""
    config = Config()

    # Initialize model list without OpenAI
    models = initialize_model_list(config, disabled_providers={"openai"})

    # Create a conversation with calculator tool
    conversation = ConversationWithTools(models, tools=[CalculatorTool()])

    # Run conversation with calculation request that models would struggle with
    complex_calculation = (
        "I need to verify a complex calculation. What is "
        "1234567890 * 9876543210 / 123456789? "
        "Please use the calculator tool to compute this precisely."
    )

    result = await conversation.process_message(complex_calculation)

    # Check for calculator tool usage
    tool_markers = ["[calculator] input:", "I'll use the calculator tool"]
    assert any(marker in result["content"] for marker in tool_markers)
```

## üß† Key Implementation Guidelines

### Tool Interface Pattern

```python
# app/tools/base.py
class BaseTool:
    """Base class for all tools"""
    name: str
    description: str

    async def run(self, input: str) -> str:
        """Execute the tool with the given input"""
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

### Conversation Integration Pattern

```python
# app/tools/conversation.py
class ConversationWithTools:
    """Manages a conversation that supports tool use across multiple models."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        models: List[ModelConfig],
        tools: List[BaseTool],
        config: Optional[Config] = None,
        system_prompt: Optional[str] = None
    ):
        """Initialize with models and tools"""

    async def process_message(self, user_message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process a user message, potentially using tools, and return response"""
```

## üìù Usage Examples

### Calculator Tool

```python
# Standalone usage
calculator = CalculatorTool()
result = await calculator.run("sqrt(16) + 10")  # Returns "14.0"

# In conversation
conversation = ConversationWithTools(models, tools=[calculator], config=config)
response = await conversation.process_message(
    "What is 1234567890 * 9876543210? This is a complex calculation so please use the calculator."
)
```

### Anticipated Web Search Tool Usage

```python
# Standalone usage
search = BraveSearchTool(config=config)
results = await search.run("latest developments in quantum computing")

# With fallback options
search = WebSearchTool(
    primary_provider="brave",  # Now using Brave as primary provider
    fallback_providers=["tavily", "duckduckgo"],
    config=config
)
results = await search.run("news about AI regulations")

# In conversation
conversation = ConversationWithTools(models, tools=[search], config=config)
response = await conversation.process_message(
    "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
)
```
