## Introduction

The proxy authentication system enables secure communication between the client app and third-party APIs without exposing sensitive API keys on the client side. It leverages a server-side proxy that authenticates clients using SUI-signed tokens.

## Key Components

### 1. Proxy Server

- **API Gateway**

  - Acts as a gateway between the client and external APIs (e.g., AI services).
  - Routes requests and adds necessary authentication headers.

- **Authentication Handler**

  - Verifies client authentication tokens.
  - Ensures only authorized requests are processed.

- **Rate Limiting**

  - Implements per-user rate limits to prevent abuse.
  - Protects both the proxy server and external APIs from overload.

- **Usage Monitoring**
  - Logs requests for auditing and analytics.
  - Tracks usage per user for potential billing or quotas.

### 2. Client Authentication

- **SUI-Signed Tokens**

  - Clients sign a nonce or challenge with their private key.
  - The signature is sent alongside requests to the proxy.

- **Session Management**

  - The proxy may issue short-lived session tokens after verification.
  - Reduces the need to sign every request, improving performance.

- **Request Signing**
  - Critical requests may require additional signing for security.
  - Ensures integrity and authenticity of sensitive operations.

### 3. Secure Communication

- **HTTPS**

  - All communication between the client and proxy uses HTTPS.
  - Encrypts data in transit to prevent interception.

- **No API Keys on Client**
  - API keys for third-party services remain securely on the proxy.
  - Eliminates risk of keys being extracted from the app.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Proxy Server

- **Choose a Hosting Environment**

  - Deploy the proxy on a secure and scalable platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

- **Implement API Routing**

  - Configure routes that map client requests to external API endpoints.
  - Include logic to add necessary authentication headers.

- **Integrate SUI Verification**
  - Implement signature verification using SUI libraries.
  - Validate that the signature matches the expected public key.

### 2. Develop Authentication Flow

- **Nonce Generation**

  - The proxy provides a unique nonce or challenge for the client to sign.
  - Prevents replay attacks by ensuring each signature is unique.

- **Signature Verification**

  - Upon receiving a signed nonce, the proxy verifies it using the client's public key.
  - Establishes trust in the client's identity.

- **Session Tokens (Optional)**
  - Issue JWT or similar tokens after successful authentication.
  - Tokens include expiration to enhance security.

### 3. Update the Client App

- **Authentication Requests**

  - Implement logic to request a nonce from the proxy.
  - Sign the nonce using the SUI wallet and send back to the proxy.

- **Request Headers**

  - Attach authentication tokens or signatures to subsequent requests.
  - Ensure headers are properly formatted.

- **Error Handling**
  - Handle authentication failures gracefully.
  - Provide feedback to the user and options to retry.

### 4. Secure the Proxy

- **Rate Limiting**

  - Prevent excessive requests from a single client.
  - Protects against denial-of-service attacks.

- **Logging and Monitoring**

  - Keep detailed logs of requests and responses.
  - Monitor for suspicious activity.

- **API Key Management**
  - Store external API keys securely on the server.
  - Implement key rotation policies.

## Security Considerations

- **Prevent Replay Attacks**

  - Use nonces and short-lived tokens.
  - Validate timestamps and sequence numbers when applicable.

- **Protect Against Man-in-the-Middle**

  - Enforce HTTPS for all communications.
  - Use HSTS and other headers to enhance security.

- **Secure Storage**
  - Protect sensitive data on the proxy server.
  - Use encrypted storage and environment variables.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**

  - Keeps API keys off the client, reducing risk exposure.
  - Utilizes blockchain-based authentication for robust security.

- **Simplified Client App**

  - The client does not need to manage multiple API keys.
  - Reduces complexity and potential for errors.

- **Scalable Management**
  - Centralizes API key management and usage monitoring.
  - Eases updates and maintenance.

## Potential Challenges

- **Latency**

  - Adds an extra hop between the client and external APIs.
  - Mitigate with efficient server and network choices.

- **Single Point of Failure**

  - The proxy becomes critical infrastructure.
  - Ensure high availability and redundancy.

- **Authentication Overhead**
  - Initial authentication may require extra steps.
  - Balance security with user experience.

By implementing proxy authentication, we secure communication with external services, protect sensitive API keys, and provide a robust and scalable framework for client-server interactions.
