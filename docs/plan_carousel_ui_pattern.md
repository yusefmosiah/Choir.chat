VERSION carousel_ui: 6.0

The Carousel UI Pattern implements an intuitive navigation system for the Chorus Cycle, enabling users to seamlessly traverse different phases through natural swipe gestures. Built on the invariant principles of user-friendly navigation, clear phase distinction, and responsive design, the pattern leverages SwiftUI's capabilities while assuming sequential phase progression and robust gesture support.

At its foundation, the pattern prioritizes intuitive navigation through familiar iOS gestures, allowing users to swipe left or right between phases while providing clear visual feedback through distinct phase representations and progress indicators. The implementation employs smooth transitions and responsive animations to enhance perceived performance, while maintaining comprehensive accessibility support for various screen sizes, orientations, and assistive technologies like VoiceOver.

The technical implementation centers around SwiftUI's TabView with PageTabViewStyle, creating a fluid carousel experience that handles basic swipe gestures automatically. Each phase view encapsulates its specific content while maintaining consistent styling and interaction patterns. The system implements sophisticated loading indicators for each phase, ensuring users remain informed of content status while preserving a smooth experience during data retrieval and processing.

Accessibility remains a core focus, with careful attention paid to VoiceOver support through proper labeling and hierarchical content organization. The implementation supports dynamic type through relative font sizing, ensuring text remains readable across all user preferences. The pattern allows for extensive customization of page indicators and transition animations, enabling perfect alignment with the application's visual theme.

The user experience carefully balances progress awareness through clear phase indication, state preservation across navigation events, and robust error handling with clear user feedback. This approach maintains user engagement through interactive elements and natural gesture interactions while reducing cognitive load by focusing attention on one phase at a time.

The pattern addresses several key challenges through careful optimization. Content organization prevents information overload by breaking complex data into digestible segments. Performance optimization ensures smooth transitions through asynchronous content loading and efficient resource management. The implementation maintains consistent usability across various device sizes through careful scaling and layout management.

Through this thoughtful implementation, the Carousel UI Pattern enhances the Chorus Cycle experience by providing an intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing navigation system that aligns with modern iOS design principles while maintaining robust accessibility and performance characteristics.
