## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **CHI-12 ‚Üí CHI-17:** Development environment must be ready before documentation updates
2. **CHI-17 ‚Üí CHI-13:** Current documentation needed for informed LangGraph research
3. **CHI-13 ‚Üí CHI-14:** Research conclusions inform infrastructure decisions

### Parallel Opportunities
- **CHI-12 and CHI-17:** Can be worked on simultaneously by different team members
- **CHI-14 Infrastructure:** Can begin while CHI-13 research is ongoing

### Critical Path
The critical path runs through documentation updates (CHI-17) since this provides the foundation for all subsequent development work. Without current documentation, research and infrastructure decisions lack proper context.

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Integration Complexity:** Mitigation through incremental implementation and testing
- **uv Migration Issues:** Mitigation through parallel development and gradual transition
- **AWS Bedrock Limitations:** Mitigation through multi-provider architecture
- **LangGraph Learning Curve:** Mitigation through dedicated research time and documentation

### Project Risks
- **Documentation Drift:** Mitigation through automated documentation testing and review processes
- **Team Alignment:** Mitigation through regular reviews and shared documentation
- **Scope Creep:** Mitigation through clear Phase 1 boundaries and success criteria
- **Timeline Pressure:** Mitigation through realistic estimates and parallel work streams

- **CHI-6**: Token Economics (citation quality affects rewards)
- **CHI-7**: All 5 Instruments (orchestration patterns)

The **meta-planning breakthrough** could be huge‚Äîgiving models agentic planning freedom while maintaining quality and consistency. This moves beyond hardcoded workflows toward true collaborative intelligence.

Your approach of building the same functionality in parallel frameworks is brilliant for making informed architectural decisions rather than theoretical speculation.
