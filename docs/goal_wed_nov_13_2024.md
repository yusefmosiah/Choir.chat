"Thread integrity",
"Value distribution"
}
assumptions: {
"Swift implementation",
"API deployment",
"Contract readiness"
}
docs_version: "0.1.0"

## Core Implementation Goals

### 1. User & Thread Persistence
- [ ] Implement `UserManager` with key generation
  - [ ] Basic key pair generation
  - [ ] UserDefaults storage (dev)
  - [ ] Thread association
- [ ] Create thread persistence layer
  - [ ] Local storage
  - [ ] API synchronization
  - [ ] Message history

### 2. API Deployment & Device Integration
- [ ] Deploy API to development environment
  - [ ] Configure local testing
  - [ ] Set up logging
  - [ ] Enable CORS
- [ ] Implement device sync
  - [ ] API client integration
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Retry logic

### 3. Reward Implementation
- [ ] New Message Rewards
  ```
  R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT)
  ```
  - [ ] Implement calculation
  - [ ] Add distribution logic
  - [ ] Test with sample data

- [ ] Prior Rewards
  ```
  V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i)
  ```
  - [ ] Implement quality scoring
  - [ ] Add treasury integration
  - [ ] Test distribution

### 4. UI Components
- [ ] Thread Sheet
  - [ ] Basic thread display
  - [ ] Message list
  - [ ] Co-author management
  - [ ] Action buttons

### 5. Smart Contract
- [ ] Thread Contract
  - [ ] Ownership tracking
  - [ ] Token mechanics
  - [ ] Temperature evolution
  - [ ] Value distribution

## Launch Preparation
- [ ] Test environment setup
- [ ] Sample data generation
- [ ] User onboarding flow
- [ ] Basic documentation
- [ ] Launch event planning

## Testing Strategy
1. User Management
   - [ ] Key generation
   - [ ] Thread association
   - [ ] Persistence

2. API Integration
   - [ ] Endpoint testing
   - [ ] Error scenarios
   - [ ] Performance

3. Reward System
   - [ ] Calculation accuracy
   - [ ] Distribution logic
   - [ ] Edge cases

## Success Criteria
1. Users can:
   - Generate and persist keys
   - Create and join threads
   - Send and receive messages

2. System can:
   - Deploy and run stably
   - Process rewards correctly
   - Maintain thread state

3. Contract can:
   - Track ownership
   - Handle tokens
   - Manage temperature

## Next Steps
1. Morning
   - Setup development environment
   - Begin user implementation
   - Deploy API

2. Afternoon
   - Implement rewards
   - Create thread sheet
   - Test contract

3. Evening
   - Integration testing
   - Documentation
   - Launch prep

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality first
- Keep implementation simple for initial release
- Document key decisions
- Maintain test coverage
- Plan for iteration

This plan aligns with our harmonic principles while focusing on practical implementation needs for launch.
