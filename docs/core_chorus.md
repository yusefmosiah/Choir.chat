# Core Chorus Cycle

VERSION core_chorus: 6.0

The chorus cycle operates as a distributed event sequence, coordinating state changes across the network through well-defined transitions. Each phase of the cycle generates specific events that ripple through the system, creating waves of coordinated state change.

The cycle begins with Action - pure response generation without context. Events mark the start of processing, capture the generated response, and record confidence levels. This creates a clean foundation for the rest of the cycle.

Experience follows, enriching the response with prior knowledge. The system searches for relevant priors, measuring semantic relevance across the network. This phase connects current insight with accumulated knowledge, strengthening the semantic fabric of the system.

Intention aligns the evolving response with user goals. Through careful analysis of both explicit and implicit signals, this phase ensures that the response serves its purpose. Events track this alignment process, enabling the system to learn from each interaction.

Observation records the emerging semantic connections. As links form between current insights and prior knowledge, events capture these relationships. The network of understanding grows stronger with each new connection, each citation, each recognized pattern.

Understanding evaluates the system state, deciding whether to continue cycling or move to completion. This critical phase prevents premature convergence while ensuring efficient processing. Events track these decisions, maintaining the integrity of the cycle.

Yield produces the final response, but only when the cycle has truly completed its work. Citations are generated, effects are distributed across the network, and the system prepares for the next interaction. The cycle maintains its integrity through careful event logging and state tracking.

Each phase operates through distributed coordination. Foundation models process language. Vector stores manage semantic relationships. Embedding services capture meaning. Chain actors maintain state consensus. All of these services work together through clean event flows and careful state management.

The cycle's power lies in its distributed nature. No single service controls the process. Instead, collective intelligence emerges through coordinated event flows and careful state transitions. The system maintains coherence while enabling natural evolution.

This is how the chorus cycle enables collective intelligence - not through central control but through carefully coordinated event flows. Each cycle strengthens the network's understanding, builds semantic relationships, and enables natural knowledge growth.
