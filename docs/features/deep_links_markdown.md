# Unified Markdown with translucent modal Previews for Deep Links

---

## Objective

Embed **deep links** inside Markdown content, but **avoid jumping** to arbitrary thread positions.

---

## How it works

- **All phase content** is **converted to Markdown**.
- Search results and citations **inject links**.
- When tapped:
  - A **translucent modal overlay** appears with a **preview** of the linked content.
  - The user can **read** without losing context.
  - Optionally, the user can **navigate** to the thread start or summary, if permitted.
- **No inline expansion** or direct deep linking into long threads.

---

## Benefits

- **Preserves pagination** and reading flow.
- **Respects privacy** and access control.
- **Simplifies UX** by avoiding context loss.
- **Prepares for future** thread contracts and sharing features.

---

## Summary

Deep links in Markdown **show translucent modal previews** instead of jumping, balancing rich linking with privacy and usability.
