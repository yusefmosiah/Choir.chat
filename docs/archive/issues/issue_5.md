## Description

Implement the carousel-based UI pattern for navigating through Chorus Cycle phases, with a focus on typographic design and fluid interactions. The interface should show previews of adjacent phases while maintaining clarity and usability.

## Tasks

### 1. Carousel Implementation

- **Basic TabView Setup**

  ```swift
  struct ChorusCarouselView: View {
      @State private var currentPhase: Phase = .action
      @ObservedObject var viewModel: ChorusViewModel

      var body: some View {
          TabView(selection: $currentPhase) {
              ForEach(Phase.allCases) { phase in
                  PhaseView(phase: phase, viewModel: viewModel)
                      .tag(phase)
              }
          }
          .tabViewStyle(.page)
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. Phase Views

- **Individual Phase Display**

  ```swift
  struct PhaseView: View {
      let phase: Phase
      @ObservedObject var viewModel: ChorusViewModel

      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              // Phase content with typographic styling
              // Adjacent phase previews
              // Loading states
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Animations and Transitions

- Implement smooth phase transitions
- Add loading state animations
- Handle gesture-based navigation

### 4. Accessibility

- Support VoiceOver
- Implement Dynamic Type
- Add accessibility labels and hints

## Success Criteria

- Smooth navigation between phases
- Clear visibility of current and adjacent phases
- Responsive animations and transitions
- Full accessibility support

## Future Considerations

- Advanced gesture controls
- Custom transition animations
- Enhanced typographic treatments
