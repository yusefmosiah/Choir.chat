# Choir: User and Thread Management Implementation Plan

## 1. User Management
- [ ] Implement secure key generation
  - [ ] Create `UserManager` with public/private key generation
  - [ ] Migrate from `UserDefaults` to iOS Keychain for production
  - [ ] Add key backup and recovery mechanism

- [ ] User Identification
  - [ ] Use public key as user identifier
  - [ ] Add optional display name or username
  - [ ] Implement user profile management

## 2. Thread Management
- [ ] Thread Model Enhancements
  - [ ] Add `userId` to `Thread` model
  - [ ] Add metadata fields (created_at, last_accessed, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement thread archiving/deletion

- [ ] Backend API Endpoints
  - [ ] Create `/threads` endpoints
    - [ ] `GET /threads` - Retrieve user's threads
    - [ ] `POST /threads` - Create new thread
    - [ ] `DELETE /threads/{threadId}` - Delete thread
    - [ ] `PUT /threads/{threadId}` - Update thread metadata

- [ ] Frontend Thread Management
  - [ ] Implement thread list view
  - [ ] Add thread creation UI
  - [ ] Develop thread selection and management logic

## 3. Message Persistence
- [ ] Message Storage
  - [ ] Design message storage schema
  - [ ] Implement message saving for each thread
  - [ ] Add pagination for message retrieval

- [ ] Sync Mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement local caching of messages
  - [ ] Design sync strategy for multiple devices

## 4. Security Considerations
- [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Implement request signing with private key
  - [ ] Add token-based authentication
  - [ ] Secure thread and message access

- [ ] Data Protection
  - [ ] Encrypt sensitive message data
  - [ ] Implement secure key management
  - [ ] Add biometric/passcode protection for app access

## 5. API Client Updates
- [ ] Add user ID to API requests
- [ ] Implement robust error handling
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for network requests
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging for debugging

## 6. User Experience
- [ ] Onboarding Flow
  - [ ] First-time user key generation
  - [ ] Explain key and thread management
  - [ ] Provide clear user guidance

- [ ] UI/UX Improvements
  - [ ] Design thread list interface
  - [ ] Create thread creation modal
  - [ ] Implement thread search and filtering

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Test key generation
  - [ ] Validate thread creation
  - [ ] Check message storage and retrieval

- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] Test API interactions
  - [ ] Verify thread and message sync
  - [ ] Check multi-device scenarios

## 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement efficient caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add lazy loading for messages
- [ ] Monitor and improve API response times

## 9. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multi-device synchronization
- [ ] Collaborative thread features
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Export/import thread functionality

## 10. Compliance and Privacy
- [ ] GDPR compliance
- [ ] Data minimization
- [ ] User consent mechanisms
- [ ] Transparent data handling policies
