# Architecture Reorganization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan for reorganizing Choir's documentation to reflect our architectural pivot from a graph-based implementation (LangGraph) to an actor-based architecture. The plan covers both structure and content changes needed to accurately document the new architecture.

## Objectives

1. **Accurately Reflect the New Architecture**: The documentation should properly explain the actor model approach that has replaced the graph-based architecture.
2. **Provide Clear Migration Guidance**: Developers familiar with the previous architecture need a clear path for understanding and adopting the new approach.
3. **Organize Information Hierarchically**: Create a documentation structure that progresses from concepts to implementation details.
4. **Preserve Valuable Content**: Retain and transform relevant content from existing documentation.
5. **Integrate Code Examples**: Connect documentation with real implementation examples from the codebase.

## New Documentation Structure

The documentation will be reorganized into the following hierarchy:

```

```

## Content Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Documentation

1. **Actor Model Overview** (1-concepts/actor_model_overview.md)
   - Create comprehensive introduction to actor model principles
   - Explain advantages over graph-based approaches
   - Connect to conceptual implementation in `actor_model.py`
   - Reference example in `examples/phase_worker_pool_demo.py`

2. **Architecture Transition Narrative** (architecture_transition_narrative.md)
   - Create narrative explaining the journey from graphs to actors
   - Document key decision points and lessons learned
   - Describe benefits of the actor approach for Post Chain

3. **Stack Argument** (2-architecture/stack_argument.md)
   - Migrate and expand content from existing stack_argument.md
   - Detail technology choices (Thespian, libSQL/Turso, PySUI, etc.)
   - Explain synergies between technologies

4. **Phase Worker Pool Documentation** (2-architecture/phase_worker_pool.md)
   - Base on content from phase_worker_pool_architecture.md
   - Reference implementation in examples/phase_worker_pool_demo.py

### Phase 2: Implementation Documentation

5. **Message Protocol Reference** (3-implementation/message_protocol_reference.md)
   - Create comprehensive guide to message formats
   - Document all message types and structures
   - Provide examples from actual code

6. **State Management Patterns** (3-implementation/state_management_patterns.md)
   - Document patterns for actor state management
   - Cover persistence with libSQL/Turso
   - Connect to implementation in turso_integration.py

7. **Developer Quickstart** (3-implementation/developer_quickstart.md)
   - Create practical guide to getting started
   - Include setup instructions, basic examples
   - Reference run_post_chain.py as a working example

8. **Actor Implementation Guide** (3-implementation/actor_implementation_guide.md)
   - Create step-by-step guide for implementing new actors
   - Provide patterns and best practices
   - Reference real examples from codebase

## Code Integration Strategy

Existing code files provide valuable examples that should be integrated into the documentation:

1. **actor_model.py**
   - Reference in actor_model_overview.md
   - Use examples in message_protocol_reference.md
   - Extract patterns for state_management_patterns.md

2. **run_post_chain.py**
   - Feature in developer_quickstart.md
   - Use as example in actor_implementation_guide.md

3. **turso_integration.py**
   - Reference in libsql_integration.md
   - Use examples in state_management_patterns.md

4. **examples/phase_worker_pool_demo.py**
   - Feature in phase_worker_pool.md
   - Reference in actor_implementation_guide.md

## Metadata and Cross-Referencing

To ensure a cohesive documentation experience:

1. **Every document should include**:
   - Creation/updated dates
   - Relevant file references
   - Clear navigation links

2. **Cross-references**:
   - Documents should link to related content
   - Code examples should reference documentation
   - Implementation docs should reference concepts

## Documentation Style Guidelines

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Documentation must precisely reflect the current implementation
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with concepts, then progressively reveal implementation details
3. **Code Examples**: Include real code examples from the codebase with proper attribution
4. **Diagrams**: Use mermaid.js for consistent diagram style (code-as-diagrams)
5. **Markdown Formatting**: Consistent heading structure, code blocks, and emphasis

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Core architecture documents
   - Actor Model Overview
   - Architecture Transition Narrative
   - Stack Argument

2. **Week 2**: Implementation documents
   - Message Protocol Reference
   - State Management Patterns
   - Developer Quickstart

3. **Week 3**: Integration & Operations
   - libSQL Integration
   - Blockchain Integration
   - Deployment guides

4. **Week 4**: Business, Concepts, & Cleanup
   - Business documentation
   - Conceptual refinement
   - Cross-linking and validation

## Success Metrics

The documentation reorganization will be considered successful when:

1. New developers can understand and contribute to the actor-based implementation
2. Existing developers can clearly see how to migrate from the graph approach
3. All major components and patterns are documented with real code examples
4. Documentation structure reflects the architectural organization

## Next Steps

1. Create the basic directory structure
2. Implement the reorganization script
3. Begin with high-priority documents
4. Review and refine
