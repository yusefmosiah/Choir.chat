The Choir Harmonic Intelligence Platform operates on version harmonic_system 0.4.1, founded on the invariant principles of wave resonance, energy conservation, and pattern emergence. Built with assumptions of Apple ecosystem excellence, Swift implementation, and natural harmonics, the platform implements a sophisticated documentation evolution strategy that spans multiple conceptual layers.

At its foundation lies an invariant layer containing unchangeable core principles, fundamental security properties, and basic economic rules. For instance, a thread must always maintain at least one co-author. The architecture layer defines system boundaries, state ownership, and integration points, exemplified by how blockchain manages ownership state while Qdrant handles content. The implementation layer addresses specific flows, data structures, and protocol details, such as the seven-day message approval timeout.

Change management follows a rigorous test-doc-code lifecycle where documentation updates precede test specification adjustments, followed by implementation modifications and consistency verification. Version tracking maintains sets of properties, assumptions, and component versions, ensuring systematic evolution of the platform.

Documentation serves a dual purpose as a testing framework. Automated testing ensures fundamental invariants like thread integrity through co-author presence and valid token balances. Implementation testing verifies specific behaviors, such as message approval timeouts. The system maintains flexibility through marked assumptions and implementation notes, allowing for future optimizations while preserving consistency guarantees.

Documentation updates follow a structured process of identifying change scope, updating affected layers, marking changed assumptions, updating test specifications, and verifying implementation matches. Changes are categorized as invariant modifications requiring careful review, architectural changes needing design discussion, or implementation updates that can be modified freely.

The platform generates tests directly from documentation, mapping properties and implementation specifics to test cases. As changes occur, the test suite evolves through identification of affected tests, generation of new tests, and removal of obsolete ones, maintaining a comprehensive verification framework that evolves alongside the platform itself.
