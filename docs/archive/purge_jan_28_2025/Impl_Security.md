# Security Model

VERSION security_model: 6.0

The security model builds upon natural system boundaries and flows, creating a robust framework that maintains integrity while enabling natural interaction patterns. This approach combines chain authority, local verification, and event integrity to create a comprehensive security architecture that grows stronger through use.

Chain authority forms the bedrock of the security model. The blockchain maintains authoritative state for ownership and tokens through program-derived addresses (PDAs) and carefully managed program accounts. Thread ownership verification occurs on-chain, while token custody remains under program control. Co-author lists receive blockchain verification, and message hashes anchor securely to the chain, creating an immutable foundation for system security.

Local verification complements chain authority through careful content validation. The system tracks event flows for security purposes, maintains state consistency through regular checks, monitors access patterns for anomalies, and enforces natural boundaries between components. This local-first approach enables quick validation while maintaining system security.

Event integrity flows naturally through the system, with security events following clear patterns. State transitions receive careful tracking, access patterns undergo continuous monitoring, and system boundaries maintain their integrity through natural enforcement. The system enables recovery processes when needed, ensuring resilience without compromising security.

Natural system boundaries emerge from several key mechanisms. State authority maintains clear hierarchies, with chain state governing ownership and tokens, vector state managing content and embeddings, and local state handling coordination. This authority hierarchy enables clean state flow while maintaining system integrity. Access patterns follow natural restrictions, with co-author access verified through the chain, content access validated locally, and events flowing through well-defined channels. Resource access respects isolation boundaries, while patterns emerge naturally through actual usage.

Security flows mirror natural system processes. Verification flow begins with chain state validation, proceeds through local state checks, and includes comprehensive event integrity verification. Access flow starts from chain-verified ownership, extends through content access rights, and includes careful event access pattern monitoring. Recovery flow enables natural system healing through state inconsistency detection, event flow recovery, and access pattern restoration.

The system maintains several critical security properties through these natural mechanisms. State integrity ensures chain state remains authoritative while local state maintains consistency and events flow cleanly through the system. Access control combines chain-verified ownership with locally controlled content access, ensuring events flow appropriately while resources remain properly isolated. Recovery capabilities enable state recovery through event replay, access pattern restoration, and natural system healing.

Recovery patterns follow natural system flows when needed. State recovery uses chain state as its foundation, replaying events to restore consistency while reestablishing natural boundaries. Access recovery begins with chain verification reset, restores access patterns, and reestablishes event flows while reallocating resources appropriately. System healing follows natural processes to restore boundaries, recover event flows, and reestablish state consistency.

This comprehensive security model achieves several critical objectives: maintaining clear authority boundaries, enabling natural state verification, ensuring clean event flows, supporting pattern-based security, and enabling natural recovery processes. The result is a system that maintains chain state authority, ensures event integrity, and preserves natural boundaries while enabling clean recovery when needed.

Through this carefully crafted security architecture, the system maintains robust protection while enabling natural interaction patterns. The security model grows stronger through use, adapting to emerging patterns while maintaining fundamental integrity. This approach creates a secure foundation that supports system growth while ensuring consistent protection across all components.
