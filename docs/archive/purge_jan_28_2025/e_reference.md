# Choir Reference Guide

The Choir platform operates through a set of interconnected core concepts that enable natural collaboration and value creation. At its heart, a thread functions as a collaborative space where value accumulates naturally through quality conversations. Like a resonant cavity, each thread develops its own energy state and natural frequency through participation. Co-authors emerge as key participants with approval rights, naturally rising when their contributions receive unanimous recognition. They guide the thread's evolution while sharing in its growing value. Messages represent contributions requiring unanimous co-author approval to become public, behaving like waves with potential energy (stake) that transforms based on approval outcomes. Premium status enhances these natural dynamics by providing doubled rewards on both new messages and prior citations, amplifying value flows while strengthening team formation.

Value flows through the system following precise patterns. Stake represents energy committed when submitting a message, with amounts varying based on thread temperature - hotter threads demand higher stakes, creating natural quality filters. The approval flow distributes stake to approvers when all co-authors approve a message, makes the message public, elevates the contributor to co-author status, and increases thread frequency. In contrast, denial flows strengthen the thread when any co-author denies a message, increasing thread temperature and naturally raising quality barriers while conserving energy within the thread. Split decisions maintain system balance by flowing the approvers' share to the Treasury while the deniers' share strengthens the thread, allowing temperature to evolve naturally.

Natural patterns emerge through these interactions. Temperature represents a thread's energy state, affecting stake requirements with hot threads demanding higher stakes and cool threads enabling easier participation. Natural cooling occurs over time, allowing quality to emerge through thermodynamic principles. Thread frequency indicates organizational coherence, with higher frequencies reflecting better organization as co-authors strengthen coherence and teams resonate naturally, enabling stable value accumulation. The citation network facilitates knowledge flow between threads, with citations creating value flows and prior rewards strengthening connections, leading to naturally emerging networks and growing collective intelligence.

Common questions often arise about these mechanics. Stake requirements vary because thread temperature creates natural quality filters - "hotter" threads require more energy to participate, naturally selecting for quality while "cooler" threads enable exploration. Teams crystallize naturally around valuable threads through shared participation and success, emerging from genuine alignment rather than forced structure. Premium rewards double to amplify natural value flows, creating stronger incentives for quality contribution while maintaining natural patterns. Thread value accumulates through quality contributions, denial energy, citation rewards, and natural resonance, creating sustainable growth that benefits all participants. Citations prove valuable by creating knowledge flows between threads, with the Treasury funding perpetual citation rewards to enable sustainable value flow through the knowledge network.

Best practices emerge naturally from these principles. Quality emerges through authentic contribution, careful judgment, building on prior work, and allowing patterns to develop organically. Team formation flourishes when participants find resonant threads, participate genuinely, share in success, and grow naturally. Value creation stems from focusing on quality, strengthening connections, enabling emergence, and trusting the process.

The technical foundation rests on precise terms and states. Thread IDs uniquely identify each thread cavity, while message hashes verify message integrity. Token amounts represent quantized units of platform energy, and the Treasury serves as a system reserve enabling perpetual rewards. Thread states progress from creation through active participation and voting to processing, while message states move from pending through approval or denial to processing. User states encompass basic participation, premium status, active thread engagement, and state transitions.

Through this carefully designed system of patterns and practices, Choir enables natural collaboration, sustainable value creation, and the emergence of collective intelligence. The platform's power lies in how these elements work together harmoniously, creating an environment where quality and value emerge naturally rather than through artificial constraints.
