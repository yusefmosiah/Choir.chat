# Core Knowledge Architecture

VERSION core_knowledge: 6.0

The knowledge architecture forms a distributed semantic network, weaving together vector spaces, prior knowledge, and multimodal understanding. This system maintains semantic coherence through network consensus while enabling distributed learning across the collective.

At its foundation lies the vector store, a distributed system that coordinates operations across the network. Vector searches execute with proper concurrency, parallelizing embedding generation and cache checks. The system gracefully handles network searches with built-in cancellation support, ensuring efficient resource management even under load.

Prior management operates with full network awareness. The system processes priors through parallel operations, combining vector searches with network metadata to build a comprehensive understanding. Citation recording maintains perfect synchronization across the network, updating vector indices and storage while ensuring cleanup on cancellation.

The semantic network exists as a distributed knowledge graph, processing links with careful coordination. When new messages enter the system, it updates the network graph, processes citations, and refreshes distributed embeddings in parallel. Graph queries execute with proper cancellation support, finding related content through semantic similarity.

Multimodal support enables the system to process diverse content types across the network. The modality manager handles text, images, and audio through specialized embedding services. These different modalities combine into unified embeddings that maintain semantic coherence across the network.

The implementation follows a progressive enhancement strategy that unfolds in three distinct phases. The first phase establishes the core network foundation through distributed vector storage in Qdrant, coordinated network-wide embeddings, and a robust citation network, all built upon foundational text processing capabilities.

As the system evolves, the second phase introduces enhanced capabilities. Multimodal content processing expands the system's understanding beyond text, while distributed search capabilities enable efficient knowledge retrieval. The citation system scales across the entire network, and a sophisticated knowledge graph emerges from the growing web of connections.

The third phase harnesses powerful network effects. Collective learning emerges as the system recognizes patterns across interactions. Network intelligence develops organically through accumulated knowledge. Cross-modal search capabilities enable natural exploration across different types of content, while pattern recognition spans multiple modalities to surface deeper insights.

The architecture's strength flows from several fundamental principles. Semantic coherence ensures consistent meaning across the network, while network consensus coordinates knowledge distribution. The system enables truly distributed learning, where intelligence emerges from collective interaction. Vector consistency preserves critical embedding relationships, and seamless multimodal integration unifies diverse content types into a coherent whole.

Through this careful orchestration of distributed systems, the knowledge architecture creates a self-organizing network of understanding that grows stronger with each interaction. The system's power lies in how these principles work together, creating an evolving fabric of knowledge that becomes more valuable and insightful over time.
