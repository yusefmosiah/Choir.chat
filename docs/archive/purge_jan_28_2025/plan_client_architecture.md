## Core Architecture

The system operates as a client-first platform:

### 1. Local Processing

- **On-Device AI**

  - AI processing happens on the user's device.
  - Reduces latency and improves responsiveness.
  - Enhances privacy by keeping data local.

- **Local Vector Operations**

  - Embedding generation and vector searches run locally.
  - Utilizes device capabilities for efficient computation.
  - Enables offline functionality for certain features.

- **State Management with SwiftData**

  - Persistent storage of user data using SwiftData.
  - Seamless data handling and synchronization.
  - Robust model management with automatic updates.

- **Secure Network Calls**
  - All network requests are proxied securely.
  - Sensitive data is protected during transmission.
  - API keys and secrets are managed server-side.

### 2. SUI Integration

- **User Accounts via SUI Wallet**

  - Users authenticate using their SUI blockchain wallet.
  - Ensures secure and decentralized identity management.
  - Facilitates seamless onboarding and account recovery.

- **Thread Ownership on Chain**

  - Thread creation and ownership are recorded on the SUI blockchain.
  - Provides immutable proof of authorship and contribution.
  - Enables decentralized management of content and permissions.

- **Token Mechanics through Smart Contracts**

  - CHIP tokens are managed via SUI smart contracts.
  - Supports token staking, rewards, and transfers.
  - Aligns economic incentives with platform participation.

- **Natural Blockchain Integration**
  - SUI blockchain integration is transparent to users.
  - Blockchain interactions are abstracted within the app.
  - Users benefit from blockchain security without added complexity.

### 3. UI Patterns

- **Carousel-Based Phase Display**

  - The Chorus Cycle phases are presented as a carousel.
  - Users can swipe to navigate through different phases.
  - Provides an intuitive and engaging experience.

- **Natural Swipe Navigation**

  - Gesture-based interactions enhance usability.
  - Allows users to seamlessly explore content.
  - Supports both linear and non-linear navigation.

- **Progressive Loading States**

  - Content and results load incrementally.
  - Users receive immediate feedback during processing.
  - Enhances perception of performance.

- **Fluid Animations**
  - Smooth transitions between UI elements.
  - Animations convey state changes effectively.
  - Contributes to a polished and modern interface.

## Security Model

Security is maintained through a proxy architecture and blockchain authentication:

### 1. API Proxy

- **Client Authentication with Proxy**

  - The app authenticates with a server-side proxy.
  - Authenticates requests without exposing API keys on the client.
  - Ensures secure communication between the app and backend services.

- **Managed API Keys**

  - API keys for third-party services are stored securely on the server.
  - The proxy handles requests to APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic.
  - Simplifies API management and key rotation.

- **Rate Limiting and Monitoring**

  - The proxy implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - Monitors usage patterns to detect anomalies.
  - Provides logging for auditing and analysis.

- **Usage Tracking**
  - Tracks API usage per user for billing or quota purposes.
  - Enables fair usage policies and resource allocation.
  - Supports analytics and reporting.

### 2. SUI Authentication

- **Wallet-Based Authentication**

  - Users sign authentication requests using their SUI wallet.
  - Eliminates the need for traditional passwords.
  - Leverages blockchain security for identity verification.

- **Message Signing for Auth**

  - Challenges are signed with the user's private key.
  - Verifiable signatures ensure the authenticity of requests.
  - Prevents unauthorized access and impersonation.

- **Chain-Based Permissions**

  - Access rights and permissions are stored on-chain.
  - Smart contracts enforce rules for content and token interactions.
  - Provides a transparent and tamper-proof permission system.

- **Natural Security Model**
  - Users control their own keys and assets.
  - Reduces reliance on centralized authentication systems.
  - Enhances trust through decentralization.
