# Reward System Model

VERSION reward_model: 6.0

The reward system model orchestrates value flow through network consensus, built on invariant principles of energy conservation, network consensus, and distributed rewards. The system makes foundational assumptions about event-driven flow, network verification, and chain authority to ensure robust value distribution.

Value flows through the network via three distinct event categories. Message reward events handle approvals, calculations, and distributions for new content. Prior events manage reference tracking, value calculations based on relevance, and reward issuance for knowledge reuse. Treasury events coordinate split decisions, prior reward funding, and balance updates, maintaining system-wide economic coherence.

The mathematical foundations of value calculation follow precise formulas. Thread stake pricing implements the quantum harmonic oscillator formula E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2), where n represents the stake level (quantum number), ω indicates the thread's organization level (frequency), and ℏ represents the reduced Planck constant. New message rewards follow a temporal decay model R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT), distributing the total allocation of 2.5B tokens over a four-year period with a decay constant of approximately 2.04. Prior value calculations use the formula V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i), where treasury balance and quality scores determine value distribution.

Event processing occurs through sophisticated network coordination. The RewardProcessor actor calculates rewards using implemented formulas, logs events, obtains network consensus, submits to the chain, and emits value updates. Working in parallel, the ValueTracker actor maintains thread values, ensures network consensus on value changes, and maintains a comprehensive event log of value evolution.

Implementation details focus on robust event storage and value evolution mechanisms. The RewardEventLog model maintains comprehensive records of events, values, timestamps, and network state, with sophisticated synchronization across chain and network layers. The ValueManager actor handles value evolution, calculating new values using implemented formulas, obtaining network consensus, updating state, and recording evolution patterns.

This carefully orchestrated system ensures precise reward calculations while maintaining network consensus and chain authority. The model preserves energy conservation and value coherence while enabling pattern recognition and natural system evolution. Through this comprehensive approach, the reward system creates a self-sustaining economic engine that incentivizes quality contributions while maintaining system-wide stability.
