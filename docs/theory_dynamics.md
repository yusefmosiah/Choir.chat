# System Dynamics

VERSION theory_dynamics: 6.0

Note: This document describes the complete theoretical framework for system dynamics. The initial TestFlight implementation will focus on core functionality, with the event-driven architecture and sophisticated pattern recognition described here planned for future development phases.

The system dynamics evolve through coordinated services and network consensus, built upon invariant principles of coherence, consensus, and distributed learning, while making foundational assumptions about service coordination, network dynamics, and collective intelligence. This framework provides a roadmap for how the system will grow to support increasingly sophisticated interactions and pattern formation.

For the initial implementation, we focus on essential state management and basic service coordination to deliver a working app. The theoretical framework described here - including pattern formation, event processing, and sophisticated actor coordination - represents the system's planned evolution rather than immediate requirements.

Pattern formation emerges through network consensus, modeled by the pattern field equation ∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P,E), where P represents pattern strength, E denotes the field state, D indicates the diffusion coefficient, and f describes nonlinear coupling. This mathematical framework helps conceptualize how patterns will form and strengthen across the network as it matures.

The system will eventually implement specific dynamics through precise formulas. Thread stake pricing follows the quantum harmonic oscillator equation E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2), where n represents the stake level (quantum number), ω indicates the thread's organization level (frequency), and ℏ represents the reduced Planck constant. New message rewards implement a temporal decay model R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT), distributing 2.5B tokens over four years with a decay constant of approximately 2.04. Prior value calculations use V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i), where treasury balance and quality scores determine value distribution.

Future implementation details will focus on robust state management and pattern evolution mechanisms. The system will maintain comprehensive records of patterns, timestamps, and network state, with sophisticated synchronization across network layers. Pattern management will handle evolution based on network consensus and state updates.

This carefully orchestrated system ensures coherence while maintaining network consensus and service coordination. The model preserves state integrity and enables pattern emergence while ensuring consistency, knowledge growth, and value flow. Through this comprehensive approach, the dynamics create a self-organizing system that evolves through natural pattern formation and network consensus, building from an initial focused implementation to the full theoretical vision over time.
