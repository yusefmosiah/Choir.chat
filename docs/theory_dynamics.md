# System Dynamics

VERSION theory_dynamics: 6.0

The system dynamics evolve through coordinated services and network consensus, built upon invariant principles of event coherence, network consensus, and distributed learning, while making foundational assumptions about service coordination, network dynamics, and collective intelligence. This dynamic framework implements specific event types and pattern formation mechanisms that enable the system's evolution.

At the implementation level, the system processes action events through a structured enum that tracks event progression from initiation through completion, including started events with input strings, processed events with response strings, and completed events with confidence measures. Similarly, experience events track the flow of knowledge processing, from search initiation through prior discovery and synthesis completion. These event structures maintain state hashes for chain verification and enable comprehensive event logging.

Pattern formation emerges through network consensus, modeled by the pattern field equation ∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P,E), where P represents pattern strength, E denotes the event field, D indicates the diffusion coefficient, and f describes nonlinear coupling. This mathematical framework helps conceptualize pattern formation and strengthening across the network, potentially informing future analytics for measuring pattern evolution. Event coupling follows the model E(x,t) = ∑ᵢ Aᵢexp(ikᵢx - iωᵢt), where Aᵢ represents event amplitudes, kᵢ denotes pattern wavenumbers, and ωᵢ indicates event frequencies, providing insight into event interactions across the network.

The system implements specific dynamics through precise formulas. Thread stake pricing follows the quantum harmonic oscillator equation E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2), where n represents the stake level (quantum number), ω indicates the thread's organization level (frequency), and ℏ represents the reduced Planck constant. New message rewards implement a temporal decay model R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT), distributing 2.5B tokens over four years with a decay constant of approximately 2.04. Prior value calculations use V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i), where treasury balance and quality scores determine value distribution.

Event processing occurs through sophisticated actor-based coordination. The EventProcessor actor manages network state, event logging, and service coordination, processing events through distributed networks, maintaining logs, obtaining network consensus, and updating patterns. Working in parallel, the PatternDetector actor analyzes network events to identify resonant patterns, maintaining pattern state and network synchronization.

Implementation details focus on robust event storage and pattern evolution mechanisms. The EventStore model maintains comprehensive records of events, patterns, timestamps, and network state, with sophisticated synchronization across network layers. The PatternManager actor handles pattern evolution, updating patterns based on events, obtaining network consensus, and recording evolution patterns.

This carefully orchestrated system ensures event coherence while maintaining network consensus and service coordination. The model preserves event integrity and enables pattern emergence while ensuring state consistency, knowledge growth, and value flow. Through this comprehensive approach, the dynamics create a self-organizing system that evolves through natural pattern formation and network consensus.
