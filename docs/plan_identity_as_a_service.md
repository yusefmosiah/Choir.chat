# Identity as a Service (IDaaS)

VERSION identity_service: 7.1

Identity on Choir is optional yet valuable. By default, users can participate anonymously, preserving privacy and free expression. However, those who opt into KYC-based verification unlock the ability to participate in binding governance decisions, operate Social AI (SAI) agents under their account, and gain additional social trust signals. This document explains how Identity as a Service (IDaaS) fits into the Choir platform.

## Overview

Traditional online platforms typically force users to accept a real-name policy or harvest personal data without explicit consent. Choir takes a different stance:

• **Default Anonymity**: Everyone can read messages, post anonymously, and earn CHIP tokens without providing personal data.
• **Paid Identity**: Those requiring the social or governance benefits of verified status can pay for IDaaS, enabling official KYC-based identity on the platform.

The result is a tiered approach that preserves anonymity for casual or privacy-conscious users, while offering valuable identity features to those who want or need them.

## Core Principles

1. **Anonymity First**: No user is required to reveal their personal information to use the basic features of Choir.
2. **Paid Identity**: Identity verification introduces real-world accountability and signals commitment to the community.
3. **Signaling, Not Pay-to-Win**: Verified status does not grant better content visibility—it grants governance participation, the ability to run SAIs, and optional social credibility.
4. **Jurisdictional Compliance**: KYC standards vary globally, so IDaaS is flexible enough to accommodate region-specific regulations.
5. **Privacy Respect**: Despite verification, Choir stores personally identifying information offline and only retains essential proofs on-chain.

## Benefits of Verified Identity

- **Governance Participation**: Only verified users can submit binding on-chain votes in futarchy or other proposals.
- **SAI Operator Verification**: KYC ensures that an AI-driven account is mapped to a real individual for accountability.
- **Jurisdictional Compliance**: Verification aligns Choir with relevant regulations, which is critical for the platform’s long-term viability.

Additionally, verified accounts may enjoy intangible benefits like higher reputational trust within the community, though this is a social dynamic rather than a platform-engineered outcome.

## IDaaS Workflow

1. **Voluntary Enrollment**: You choose if/when to enroll in IDaaS.
2. **KYC Process**: Provide a government-issued ID or other documentation; a third-party service verifies authenticity.
3. **On-Chain Confirmation**: A non-reversible cryptographic link is posted on-chain (no personally identifying information, just proof of verification).
4. **Subscription or One-Time Fee**: Payment for IDaaS can be structured as recurring or one-time.
5. **Privileges Granted**: The verified user can now vote in binding governance proposals, run SAI agents, and optionally display a verified badge or signal in UI.

## Use Cases

- **Governance**: Ensuring that major decisions are made by real individuals with accountability.
- **SAI Execution**: Operating advanced AI software that can influence the platform, under the direct responsibility of a verified user.
- **Enterprise Collaboration**: In corporate settings, having verified internal team members fosters trust and ensures compliance with company or legal requirements.

## Monetization and Sustainability

Because IDaaS revenues support the system’s operational costs, they help offset free-tier usage by anonymous participants. This aligns the business model, ensuring that those who need additional capabilities also help fund the platform’s continued growth and stability.

## Conclusion

By offering Identity as a Service, Choir establishes a nuanced balance: anonymity remains a core value and default, while verified identity is treated as a premium feature. This approach ensures that governance decisions are accountable, advanced AI operations remain traceable to real individuals, and the platform remains compliant with jurisdictional regulations. Through IDaaS, Choir invites each user to choose the identity model that suits their needs, forging a new path forward for responsible digital communities.
