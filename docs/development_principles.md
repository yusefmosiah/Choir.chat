docs_version: "0.1.0"

## Core Principles

### 1. Groundedness
- Start with concrete, working implementations
- Build from actual needs rather than theoretical ideals
- Let patterns emerge from real usage
- Maintain connection to practical reality
- Avoid premature abstraction

### 2. Iterative Growth
- Take small, deliberate steps
- Validate each change through actual use
- Build on what works
- Learn from what doesn't
- Let complexity emerge naturally

### 3. Working Software
- Prioritize running code over perfect architecture
- Test through real usage
- Fix problems as they arise
- Keep things simple until complexity is needed
- Maintain a working system at all times

### 4. Natural Evolution
- Let patterns reveal themselves
- Refactor when patterns become clear
- Don't force architectural decisions
- Allow flexibility in early stages
- Recognize emergent structures

### 5. User Focus
- Build for actual user needs
- Test with real usage
- Get feedback early
- Adapt to user patterns
- Let features emerge from use

## Implementation Guidelines

### Start Simple
- Begin with minimal working features
- Add complexity only when needed
- Keep initial scope focused
- Build on solid foundations
- Validate through use

### Grow Naturally
- Add features based on real needs
- Let architecture evolve organically
- Refactor as patterns emerge
- Maintain working software
- Learn from usage

### Stay Grounded
- Avoid speculative features
- Build what's needed now
- Test with real users
- Learn from feedback
- Adapt based on evidence

### Enable Evolution
- Keep code flexible early on
- Recognize emerging patterns
- Refactor thoughtfully
- Maintain simplicity
- Allow natural growth

## Development Flow

1. **Start Small**
   - Implement minimal feature
   - Get it working
   - Test with real usage
   - Learn from feedback
   - Iterate based on needs

2. **Grow Gradually**
   - Add features incrementally
   - Maintain working system
   - Test continuously
   - Adapt to feedback
   - Build on success

3. **Evolve Naturally**
   - Notice emerging patterns
   - Refactor when clear
   - Keep things simple
   - Enable flexibility
   - Learn from usage

## Practical Application

### Current Phase: Action Step
- Building basic chat interface
- Implementing core messaging
