# Choir: Building a Tokenized Marketplace of Ideas on the Model Context Protocol

## Core Concepts

The Choir platform is a revolutionary system for building collective intelligence, structured around a sophisticated conceptual model and implemented with a cutting-edge Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture.  Explore the foundational concepts:
- [PostChain Temporal Logic](postchain_temporal_logic.md) - The temporal essence of each AEIOU-Y phase, driving dynamic and context-aware AI workflows.
- [FQAHO Model](fqaho_visualization.md) - The Fractional Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator economic model, powering a self-improving token economy that rewards quality and innovation.
- [Core Economics](core_economics.md) -  The economic principles and tokenomics of CHIP, designed to create a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for knowledge creation.
- [Core State Transitions](core_state_transitions.md) - The carefully defined state transitions that govern the evolution of threads and the flow of value within Choir.
- [Evolution: Naming](evolution_naming.md) -  The story behind the evolution of Choir's name, reflecting the project's journey and vision.

## Architecture: MCP-Powered Scalability and Modularity

Choir's technical architecture is now built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a strategic pivot that provides a robust and scalable foundation for our vision:
- [Stack Argument](stack_argument.md) -  The compelling rationale behind our technology choices, emphasizing the advantages of the MCP-based stack for Choir.
- [Security Considerations](security_considerations.md) -  A deep dive into the security architecture of Choir, highlighting the benefits of MCP and confidential computing for building a trustworthy AI platform.

## Implementation: Building the Revolution, One Phase at a Time

Explore the practical implementation of Choir's MCP-based architecture:
- [Developer Quickstart](developer_quickstart.md) -  A fast onboarding guide for developers to start building MCP-powered phases and applications for Choir.
- [State Management Patterns](state_management_patterns.md) - Best practices and design patterns for managing state efficiently and robustly within MCP-based AI systems.

## MCP-Based Context Management: Orchestrating the Flow of Knowledge

Choir leverages the power of MCP to enable sophisticated context management, with each phase playing a specialized role in orchestrating the flow of knowledge:

| Phase         | Temporal Focus       | Context Responsibility               |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Action        | Immediate present    | Initial framing and response, setting the stage for the conversation.         |
| Experience    | Past knowledge       | Enriching context with search results, knowledge graph retrievals, and relevant prior experiences.  |
| Intention     | Desired future       | Focusing on user goals and intents, guiding the AI towards user-centric outcomes.               |
| Observation   | Future preservation  | Tagging and connecting concepts, building a rich semantic network for long-term knowledge growth.      |
| Understanding | Temporal integration | Deciding what information to release and prune, optimizing context for efficiency and relevance. |
| Yield         | Process completion   | Determining cycle continuation and recursion, generating the final, user-facing response.       |

## A Vision for the Future: Personal AI and the Tokenized Marketplace of Ideas

Choir is not just building another AI application; we are building a **transformative platform for the future of AI and human collaboration**:

- **Revolutionizing Consumer Finance:** Empowering users with AI-driven tools to optimize their financial lives and achieve financial freedom.
- **Creating a Live Streaming Home Production Studio:**  Transforming home entertainment and content creation with AI-powered tools for interactive and immersive experiences.
- **Building a Tokenized Marketplace of Ideas:**  Fostering a new kind of online platform where quality ideas are valued, rewarded, and drive the emergence of collective intelligence.
- **Democratizing AI Training and Ownership:**  Enabling users to participate in and benefit from the AI revolution, owning a piece of the AI infrastructure and contributing to a self-improving, community-driven AI ecosystem.

Explore the documentation sections above to understand how Choir's MCP-based architecture is designed to realize this ambitious vision and build a truly revolutionary platform for the age of personal AI.
