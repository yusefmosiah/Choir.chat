# LangGraph PostChain Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Overview

The current Chorus Cycle implementation is a sequence of calls to a single LLM with RAG to a single vector database. The cycle follows the AEIOU-Y pattern:

1. **Action**: Initial response with "beginner's mind"
2. **Experience**: Enrichment with prior knowledge via RAG
3. **Intention**: Analysis of planned actions and consequences
4. **Observation**: Reflection on analysis and intentions
5. **Understanding**: Decision to loop back or proceed to yield
6. **Yield**: Final synthesized response

Each step uses the same model (currently Claude 3.5 Haiku) with different system prompts, and the cycle can loop back from Understanding to Action if needed.

## Migration Goals

1. Implement the Chorus Cycle using LangGraph's StateGraph
2. Create a multi-model workflow where different models handle different steps
3. Add agentic capabilities with integrated tools (Qdrant vector database and web search)
4. Improve observability and debugging
5. Enable dynamic chain modification
6. Provide a unified streaming API endpoint for the entire cycle

## Revised Chorus Cycle Flow

The new Chorus Cycle will be enhanced with integrated tools:

1. **Action**: Initial LLM response to user input (vanilla LLM call)
2. **Experience (Vector)**: Retrieve relevant information from vector database
3. **Experience (Web)**: Retrieve recent information from web search
4. **Intention**: Reflective analysis on prompt, action, and experiences
5. **Observation**: Optional storage of important insights to vector database
6. **Understanding**: Decision to continue or loop back to action
7. **Yield**: Final synthesized response

Each step can be handled by a different model provider, with proper context preservation between transitions.

## Implementation Plan for Next Phase

### 1. State Schema Update

The core state schema for our tool-enhanced Chorus Cycle:

```python
class ChorusToolState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    current_phase: str
    loop_count: int
    vector_search_results: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]
    web_search_results: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]
    stored_vector_ids: List[str]
    loop_probability: float
```

### 2. Phase Handlers with Tool Integration

Example of an Experience (Vector) phase handler:

```python
def experience_vector_handler(config: Config):
    """Handler for the vector search experience phase."""
    async def handler(state: ChorusToolState) -> ChorusToolState:
        messages = state["messages"]

        # Get the user prompt and action response
        user_prompt = next((m["content"] for m in messages if m["role"] == "user"), "")
        action_response = next((m["content"] for m in messages if m["role"] == "assistant"
                              and m.get("phase") == "action"), "")

        # Set up the system message for this phase
        system_message = {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are the Experience phase of the Chorus Cycle. "
                "Your task is to search the vector database for relevant information "
                "related to the user's query and previous interactions. "
                "You have access to the qdrant_search tool to find semantic matches."
            )
        }

        # Create a message for the model to use the vector search tool
        experience_prompt = {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                f"Please search for information relevant to this query: '{user_prompt}'\n\n"
                f"The initial response was: '{action_response}'\n\n"
                "Use the qdrant_search tool to find semantically similar content."
            )
        }

        # Use LangGraph's ToolNode pattern to handle the tool interaction
        model = get_tool_compatible_model(config)
        vector_search_result = await run_tool_interaction(
            model=model,
            tools=[qdrant_search],
            messages=[system_message, experience_prompt]
        )

        # Extract and store the search results
        vector_search_results = extract_search_results(vector_search_result)

        # Update the state
        new_messages = messages + [{
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": vector_search_result["messages"][-1]["content"],
            "phase": "experience_vector"
        }]

        return {
            **state,
            "messages": new_messages,
            "vector_search_results": vector_search_results,
            "current_phase": "experience_vector"
        }

    return handler
```

### 3. Unified API Endpoint

The new unified API endpoint will:

1. Accept a user query
2. Process it through the entire Chorus Cycle with tools
3. Stream the results of each phase as they complete
4. Return the final yield result

```python
@router.post("/chorus", response_model=StreamingResponse)
async def process_chorus_cycle(request: ChorusRequest):
    """Process a complete Chorus Cycle with integrated tools and streaming."""
    config = Config()

    # Initialize the Chorus graph with tools
    graph = create_chorus_tool_graph(config)

    # Create initial state
    initial_state = {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT_WITH_TIMESTAMP},
            {"role": "user", "content": request.content}
        ],
        "current_phase": "start",
        "loop_count": 0,
        "vector_search_results": None,
        "web_search_results": None,
        "stored_vector_ids": [],
        "loop_probability": 0.0
    }

    # Create streaming response
    return StreamingResponse(
        graph.astream(initial_state),
        media_type="text/event-stream"
    )
```

   - Create a unified streaming API endpoint for the entire cycle

## Conclusion

The implementation of tool-enhanced Chorus Cycle represents a significant advancement over the current design. By integrating Qdrant vector database tools and web search capabilities, we can enhance the cycle's ability to retrieve and store information, improving the quality and relevance of responses.

The revised implementation maintains the core AEIOU-Y structure while adding powerful new capabilities:

1. **Richer Context**: Vector search and web search provide more comprehensive information
2. **Memory Enhancement**: Vector storage allows observations to be persisted for future reference
3. **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Different models can handle different phases of the cycle
4. **Tool Agentic Capabilities**: Models can use tools within the appropriate phases

This plan outlines a clear path forward to implementing a unified, streaming API endpoint that leverages the full power of the PostChain architecture with LangGraph and integrated tools.
