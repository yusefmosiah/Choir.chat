# LangGraph PostChain Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Overview

The current Chorus Cycle implementation is a sequence of calls to a single LLM with RAG to a single vector database. The cycle follows the AEIOU-Y pattern:

1. **Action**: Initial response with "beginner's mind"
2. **Experience**: Enrichment with prior knowledge via RAG
3. **Intention**: Analysis of planned actions and consequences
4. **Observation**: Reflection on analysis and intentions
5. **Understanding**: Decision to loop back or proceed to yield
6. **Yield**: Final synthesized response

Each step uses the same model (currently Claude 3.5 Haiku) with different system prompts, and the cycle can loop back from Understanding to Action if needed.

## Migration Goals

1. Implement the Chorus Cycle using LangGraph's StateGraph
2. Create a multi-model workflow where different models handle different steps
3. Add agentic capabilities with tools and dynamic routing
4. Improve observability and debugging
5. Enable dynamic chain modification

## Revised Implementation Approach

Our implementation approach will be highly iterative, focusing on validating each component individually before composition:

1. **Environment Setup**: First, add dependencies and configure API keys for all providers
2. **Individual Model Testing**: Test each model in isolation before integration
3. **Basic LangGraph**: Start with a simple single-node graph before building complexity
4. **Incremental Integration**: Add components one at a time with thorough testing
5. **Feature Tracking**: Use a checklist approach to track progress empirically

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to migrating the current Chorus Cycle to a multi-model agentic workflow using LangGraph. The resulting system will be more flexible, maintainable, and powerful, while preserving the core AEIOU-Y cycle functionality.

The migration can be performed incrementally, starting with a basic LangGraph implementation and gradually adding more advanced features like multi-model support, tool integration, and dynamic routing. This approach allows for continuous testing and evaluation throughout the development process.

The final system will leverage the strengths of different models for different steps of the cycle, use tools to enhance capabilities, and provide better observability and debugging features. It will also be more extensible, allowing for future enhancements like multi-agent orchestration, memory management, and custom model integration.
