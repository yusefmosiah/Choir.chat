# Evolution: Token Economics for the Learning Economy

VERSION token_economics: 1.0 (Learning Economy Foundation)

## Overview

CHOIR token economics serve as the foundational infrastructure for transforming intellectual contribution into economic opportunity. Unlike traditional social media tokens that optimize for engagement or attention, CHOIR tokens create economic incentives aligned with intellectual virtue and collaborative intelligence. This document outlines the token economic model that enables the learning economy transition.

## The Learning Economy Token Model

Traditional economic models reward skill performance and credential acquisition. The learning economy rewards insight generation, collaborative intelligence, and intellectual contribution. CHOIR tokens provide the economic infrastructure for this fundamental shift.

### Core Economic Principles

1. **Intellectual Property Rights:** CHOIR tokens enable genuine intellectual property ownership through citation economics, where original insights generate appreciating assets rather than ephemeral social media engagement.

2. **Collaborative Value Creation:** Token rewards flow to contributors when their insights prove foundational for others, creating shared ownership relationships where collaborative intelligence generates value for all participants.

3. **Merit-Based Distribution:** Token allocation based on intellectual merit rather than social status, engagement metrics, or demographic targeting.

4. **Sustainable Economics:** Token economics serve intellectual flourishing rather than exploiting psychological vulnerabilities for platform growth.

## Citation Economics: The Core Value Driver

Citation economics represent the primary innovation in CHOIR token distribution, creating ongoing compensation when others reference your contributions:

### Citation Reward Mechanism
- **5 CHOIR tokens per citation** when others reference your published work
- Rewards flow automatically when citations are detected in new publications
- No time limit on citation rewards—valuable insights generate ongoing compensation
- Cryptographic attribution ensures proper credit and payment

### Citation Value Scaling
- Citations in highly-cited work generate bonus rewards
- Cross-disciplinary citations receive multiplier bonuses
- Collaborative citations share rewards among all contributors
- Citation networks create compound value for foundational insights

### Intellectual Property Rights
- Published content becomes intellectual property generating ongoing revenue
- Citation tracking creates verifiable contribution records
- Collaborative ownership through shared citation rewards
- Transferable intellectual property rights through token mechanics

## Novelty Rewards: Incentivizing Original Thinking

Novelty rewards recognize genuinely original contributions that expand collective knowledge into unexplored semantic territory:

### Novelty Calculation
- AI calculates semantic similarity to existing content in knowledge base
- Exponential reward scaling: higher novelty generates disproportionately higher rewards
- Novelty scores range from 0.0 (complete duplication) to 1.0 (entirely novel)
- Rewards scale exponentially to incentivize breakthrough insights

### Reward Distribution Scale
- **0.01 CHOIR** at 0.95 similarity (minor variations)
- **0.1 CHOIR** at 0.9 similarity (modest improvements)
- **1.0 CHOIR** at 0.85 similarity (significant contributions)
- **10.0 CHOIR** at 0.8 similarity (major innovations)
- **100.0 CHOIR** at 0.75 similarity (breakthrough insights)

### Quality Assurance
- Novelty rewards require minimum quality thresholds
- Community validation through citation patterns
- Economic penalties for consistently low-quality novel content
- AI-assisted quality assessment to prevent gaming
