# Migration Plan: LangGraph to Actor Model

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step migration plan for transitioning the Choir PostChain from a LangGraph-based implementation to an actor model architecture using Thespian. The migration is designed to be incremental, allowing for testing and validation at each stage.

## Migration Goals

   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guides

## Migration Mapping

This table maps LangGraph concepts to their Actor Model equivalents:

| LangGraph Concept  | Actor Model Equivalent   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Node               | Actor                    |
| Edge               | Message Pattern          |
| State Dict         | Distributed Actor States |
| StateGraph         | ActorSystem              |
| Checkpoint         | Persisted Actor States   |
| Configurable Field | Actor Configuration      |
| Channel            | Message Type             |
| Invoke             | process_input()          |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. PostChain functionality is implemented in the actor model
3. Context is processed and remembered by actors
4. State persistence is reliable and synchronized
5. End-to-end tests pass consistently

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from LangGraph to the actor model. By following this incremental process, we can maintain system stability while gaining the benefits of the actor model: improved state management, fault isolation, and a more natural fit for agent-based AI systems.
