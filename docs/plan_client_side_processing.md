## Introduction

Moving processing tasks to the client-side leverages device capabilities to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance user privacy by keeping data on the device.

## Key Components

### 1. On-Device AI Models

- **Language Models**

  - Utilize models like GPT-2 or smaller, optimized for on-device use.
  - Handle natural language understanding and generation tasks.

- **Embeddings**

  - Generate vector embeddings for text using models like MobileBERT.
  - Enable efficient similarity searches and semantic analysis.

- **Model Optimization**
  - Use techniques like quantization and pruning to reduce model size.
  - Employ libraries like Core ML and TensorFlow Lite for performance.

### 2. Local Data Storage

- **SwiftData for Persistence**

  - Manage user data, messages, and thread information locally.
  - Ensure data consistency and integrity with robust models.

- **Data Security**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
  - Use Keychain services for storing credentials and keys.

### 3. Processing Workflows

- **Chorus Cycle Phases**

  - Implement each phase of the Chorus Cycle to run locally.
  - Design workflows that connect outputs and inputs seamlessly.

- **Thread and Message Handling**

  - Process message approvals and thread updates on-device.
  - Synchronize with the blockchain or server when needed.

- **Error Handling**
  - Detect and handle processing errors gracefully.
  - Provide feedback to users and options to retry.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Model Integration

- **Select Appropriate Models**

  - Choose models balancing performance and size.
  - Test models on target devices to ensure acceptable performance.

- **Convert Models for On-Device Use**

  - Use Core ML Tools to convert models into Core ML format.
  - Optimize models during conversion.

- **Implement Model Interfaces**
  - Create classes or structs to encapsulate model usage.
  - Provide methods for inference and data preprocessing.

### 2. Workflow Development

- **Define Phase Logic**

  - Translate each Chorus Cycle phase into functions or methods.
  - Ensure inputs and outputs align for smooth transitions.

- **State Management**
  - Use `@StateObject` and `@EnvironmentObject` for data flow.
  - Keep track of the current phase and intermediate results.

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Processing**

  - Execute heavy tasks on background threads using `DispatchQueue` or `async/await`.
  - Update the UI on the main thread after processing.

- **Caching**

  - Cache model outputs where appropriate to avoid redundant computations.
  - Manage cache size to prevent excessive memory usage.

- **Battery Considerations**
  - Monitor and optimize for battery consumption.
  - Provide settings for users to adjust performance preferences.

### 4. User Privacy and Security

- **Data Handling**

  - Clearly communicate to users what data is processed locally.
  - Obtain consent if any data needs to be sent externally.

- **Compliance**
  - Ensure compliance with privacy laws and guidelines (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  - Provide options for users to delete their data.

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**

  - Reduced latency leads to a smoother user experience.
  - Eliminates network delays for processing tasks.

- **Enhanced Privacy**

  - Keeping data on-device minimizes exposure risks.
  - Builds user trust through transparent data practices.

- **Offline Capabilities**
  - Basic functionalities remain available without internet connectivity.
  - Improves accessibility for users with limited connectivity.

## Challenges

- **Device Limitations**

  - Older devices may struggle with processing demands.
  - Need to balance features with performance on lower-end hardware.

- **Model Size**

  - Larger models may not fit or perform well on mobile devices.
  - Continual optimization is required.

- **Resource Management**
  - Ensure that processing does not interfere with other app functions.
  - Manage memory and CPU usage to prevent app crashes or slowdowns.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Updates**

  - Implement mechanisms to update models as improvements are made.
  - Consider on-device training or fine-tuning with user consent.

- **Edge Computing Integration**
  - Explore leveraging nearby devices or local networks for distributed processing.
  - Potentially offload tasks while maintaining privacy.
