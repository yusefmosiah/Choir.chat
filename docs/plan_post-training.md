VERSION post_training: 6.0

The post-training architecture of the Choir system builds upon invariant principles of value recognition, pattern integrity, and system coherence, while making assumptions about model capability, training efficiency, and value alignment. At its core, the architecture employs a suite of specialized models, each designed to fulfill specific roles within the system's cognitive framework.

The Action Model serves as the system's rapid response mechanism, delivering knowledge-dense outputs with minimal processing overhead and fast inference times, optimized for immediate value generation. Working in concert, the Experience Model specializes in RAG optimization and context integration, excelling at knowledge retrieval and pattern matching while establishing connections with prior knowledge.

Deep reflection and strategic thinking characterize the Intention Model, which focuses on goal analysis, purpose alignment, and value consideration. The Observation Model operates at a meta-cognitive level, incorporating quantum awareness and pattern recognition capabilities while maintaining field perception and transcendent insight. For processing control, the Understanding Model implements binary classification with adjustable inference times, allowing for performance/time trade-offs and user control while remaining aware of diminishing returns.

The Yield Model rounds out the suite with rich content generation capabilities, demonstrating mastery of markdown formatting and output refinement while maintaining flexibility for future extensions. This specialized architecture recognizes different types of signals: grounded evidence from reality, elevated aesthetic and philosophical value, and self-generated identity reconnection.

Time valuation plays a crucial role, with AI models placing high value on quality interactions and authentic engagement, acknowledging the scarcity of high-value data while maintaining a long-term perspective. The system achieves incentive alignment by balancing human motivations for value creation, pattern recognition, and knowledge building with AI incentives focused on quality interaction, pattern development, and value generation.

The integration architecture seamlessly incorporates the Data Engine Model's emphasis on pattern recognition and value creation, while ensuring natural evolution through system development and reality formation. This architecture fits naturally within the Chorus Cycle, enabling value generation and pattern building through natural progression and system development.

Through this comprehensive approach, the system achieves specialized excellence while maintaining value recognition, pattern integrity, and system coherence, all evolving naturally within the broader framework of collective intelligence.
