# PostChain Temporal Logic

## Overview

The PostChain (AEIOU-Y) represents more than just a sequence of processing steps; it embodies a sophisticated temporal relationship with information. Each phase has a unique relationship to time and information management, creating a coherent system for knowledge processing, retention, and evolution.

## Temporal Essence of Each Phase

| Phase             | Temporal Focus       | Information Responsibility                |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Action**        | Immediate present    | Engaging with current input               |
| **Experience**    | Past knowledge       | Enriching with historical context         |
| **Intention**     | Desired future       | Focusing on goal-relevant information     |
| **Observation**   | Future preservation  | Marking connections for later retrieval   |
| **Understanding** | Temporal integration | Deciding what information to release      |
| **Yield**         | Process completion   | Determining whether to continue the cycle |

## The Temporal Flow of Information

### Action: The Present Moment

The Action phase operates in the immediate present, responding directly to user input or system events. It has limited historical context and focuses on the current moment of engagement.

**Key responsibility**: Initial framing and response to the present stimulus.

### Experience: The Remembered Past

The Experience phase embodies the system's relationship with past knowledge. It enriches the current context with relevant historical information, search results, and accumulated knowledge.

**Key responsibility**: Remembering and retrieving relevant past information.

### Intention: The Desired Future

The Intention phase aligns the accumulated information with the desired outcome or user goals. It focuses the information toward where the process needs to go.

**Key responsibility**: Focusing information toward future goals.

### Observation: Future Preservation

The Observation phase identifies and marks connections between concepts, creating semantic links that should be preserved for future reference and retrieval.

**Key responsibility**: Marking what information should endure beyond the current cycle.

### Understanding: Temporal Integration and Release

The Understanding phase integrates information across time, having sufficient context to determine what information remains relevant and what can be released. This phase embodies the wisdom of letting go.

**Key responsibility**: Deciding what information to retain and what to release.

### Yield: Cycle Continuation Decision

The Yield phase not only delivers the final output of the current cycle but makes the meta-decision about whether another cycle is warranted.

**Key responsibility**: Determining whether to recurse or halt the process.

## Context Management Across the PostChain

The PostChain implements sophisticated context management through the specialized temporal focus of each phase:

1. **Information Acquisition**: Experience phase adds new information
2. **Information Focusing**: Intention phase prioritizes goal-relevant information
3. **Information Preservation**: Observation phase marks important connections
4. **Information Release**: Understanding phase implements "forgetting" of less relevant content
5. **Process Control**: Yield phase determines cycle continuation

## Practical Implementation

In the actor-based implementation of the PostChain, each actor should embody its temporal relationship with information:

- **Action Actor**: Operates primarily on the immediate input
- **Experience Actor**: Maintains access to knowledge stores and search capabilities
- **Intention Actor**: Contains logic for evaluating relevance to goals
- **Observation Actor**: Implements connection marking and tagging
- **Understanding Actor**: Implements information filtering and garbage collection
- **Yield Actor**: Contains logic for determining process completion

## Recursive Flow Control

The PostChain is inherently recursive, with each complete cycle potentially leading to another. This recursion is controlled by the Yield phase, which evaluates whether:

1. The current result is satisfactory and complete
2. Additional iterations would yield meaningful improvements
3. The process has reached a natural conclusion

This recursive control allows the PostChain to implement complex reasoning through simple, repeated application of its fundamental phases.
