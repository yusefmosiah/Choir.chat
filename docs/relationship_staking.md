# Relationship Staking: Investing Value in Human Connections

## Overview

Relationship staking is Choir's revolutionary approach to creating meaningful connections through economic alignment. Unlike traditional social media where engagement is free (and often worthless), relationship staking requires users to invest their earned CHOIR tokens to initiate conversations, creating real skin in the game for quality discourse.

## How It Works

### Initial Connection
When you encounter a thoughtful prompt or response from another user, you can choose to respond directly by staking CHOIR tokens as a non-refundable bond. This stake demonstrates serious intent and filters out low-effort interactions.

### Response Options
The recipient has two choices:
1. **Ignore**: Keep the staked tokens and move on
2. **Engage**: Respond back, which locks both users' tokens into a shared relationship multisig

### Relationship Multisig
Once both parties engage, their staked tokens are locked in a smart contract owned jointly by both users. This creates:
- **Shared economic interest** in maintaining the relationship
- **Mutual investment** in quality discourse
- **Transferable relationship value** that belongs to the participants

## Multiparty Relationships

### Group Formation
Relationships can expand beyond pairs. When multiple users stake tokens in response to each other, they form multiparty relationships with shared token pools.

### Dynamic Membership
- **Unilateral Exit**: Any member can leave at any time, taking their proportional share of tokens
- **Organic Growth**: New members can join by staking tokens and being accepted by existing members
- **Economic Alignment**: All members have skin in the game for group success

## Key Benefits

### For Users
- **Own Your Social Value**: Unlike likes and followers, relationship stakes are transferable assets
- **Quality Filter**: Economic barriers eliminate spam and low-effort interactions
- **Meaningful Connections**: Shared investment creates deeper, more thoughtful relationships
- **Exit Rights**: Always maintain control over your invested value

### For the Platform
- **Natural Moderation**: Economic incentives align with quality discourse
- **Relationship Discovery**: AI can identify compatible users through staking patterns
- **Value Creation**: Turns social interaction from cost center to value generator
- **Network Effects**: Successful relationships attract more high-quality participants

## Economic Mechanics

### Stake Sizing
- Minimum stakes prevent spam while remaining accessible
- Dynamic pricing based on user reputation and relationship history
- Escalating stakes for deeper relationship levels

### Value Accumulation
- Successful relationships can accumulate additional value through:
  - Citation rewards when relationship content is referenced
  - Novelty rewards for collaborative insights
  - Network effects as relationships become hubs of quality discourse

### Exit Mechanisms
- **Graceful Exit**: Take proportional share and leave relationship intact
- **Relationship Dissolution**: Mutual agreement to dissolve and split all tokens
- **Dispute Resolution**: Community governance mechanisms for edge cases

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pair Relationships
- Basic staking for 1:1 connections
- Simple multisig contracts
- Core UI for relationship management

### Phase 2: Group Dynamics
- Multiparty relationship support
- Dynamic membership changes
- Advanced governance features

### Phase 3: Relationship Networks
- Cross-relationship value flows
- Reputation systems based on relationship success
- AI-powered relationship recommendations

## Why This Matters

Relationship staking solves the fundamental problem of online discourse: the lack of consequences for bad behavior and rewards for good behavior. By requiring economic investment in relationships, we create:

1. **Accountability**: Users have financial incentive to maintain quality relationships
2. **Ownership**: Social value belongs to users, not platforms
3. **Sustainability**: Economic alignment creates self-reinforcing quality cycles
4. **Meaning**: Relationships have tangible value beyond ephemeral engagement metrics

This transforms social media from an extractive attention economy into a generative relationship economy where human connections create lasting value for all participants.
