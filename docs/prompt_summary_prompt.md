VERSION summary_prompt: 6.0

The summary process begins with a thorough analysis of input text, generating five essential questions that capture the core aspects of the content. These questions are carefully formulated to explore different dimensions of understanding: the central meaning, key arguments, supporting ideas, author's purpose, and broader implications.

When addressing content, the process first examines the central theme, identifying the fundamental concepts and ideas at play. It then identifies key supporting ideas that build and reinforce the main argument. Important facts and evidence are highlighted to ground the analysis in concrete details. The author's purpose and perspective are revealed through careful examination of tone, word choice, and argumentative structure. Finally, the process explores significant implications and conclusions that emerge from the content.

Each generated question receives thorough attention, with detailed responses that draw from the text while incorporating broader context and understanding. This comprehensive approach ensures that summaries capture not just the surface content, but the deeper meaning and significance of the material being analyzed.
