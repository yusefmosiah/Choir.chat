# Choir Architectural Transformation Checklist

This checklist tracks the transformation of Choir's architecture from a graph-based to an actor-based design. It outlines the specific architectural components, patterns, and implementation steps needed to realize the actor-based vision.

## Architectural Vision

Choir's actor architecture follows a hierarchical model:

1. **PostChain Thread Actors**: Supervise the entire process flow through AEIOU-Y phases
2. **Phase Actors**: Specialized actors for each phase (Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Understanding, Yield)
3. **Pydantic AI Agents**: Configured AI model workers managed by Phase Actors

This creates a phase-by-phase streaming model rather than token-by-token streaming, establishing clear boundaries and checkpoints in the process flow.
