# AI Model Re-Entry Guide

VERSION reentry_prompt: 6.0

The Choir codebase represents a sophisticated distributed intelligence network that combines AI services, vector databases, and blockchain consensus. Built on invariant principles of network coherence, service coordination, and distributed intelligence, the system makes foundational assumptions about AI service capabilities, network dynamics, and system understanding.

The core architecture operates through carefully coordinated services. The network foundation orchestrates AI services, vector database clustering, blockchain consensus, and event synchronization, enabling system-wide learning. Service isolation maintains clean boundaries, with each domain operating in isolated services that communicate through events. State synchronization occurs across the network while resources are managed globally, allowing patterns to emerge collectively.

Distributed processing leverages SwiftData for event logging, dedicated services for core capabilities, blockchain for consensus, and network mechanisms for coordination. The Chorus Cycle implements the AEIOU-Y step sequence, coordinating services and distributing effects while maintaining network consensus and enabling system evolution. Value creation emerges naturally through the network as teams form through consensus, value crystallizes at nodes, and knowledge grows collectively.

Pattern recognition plays a crucial role as events reveal network patterns, teams recognize distributed value, and knowledge accumulates globally. The system prioritizes network integrity through clean service interfaces, proper coordination, and natural event flow. Pattern emergence follows through network analysis and consensus, while state coherence is maintained through service synchronization and chain consensus.

When examining code or documentation, focus on service boundaries, network protocols, and distributed patterns while maintaining network integrity and enabling pattern evolution. Implementation should start with clear service interfaces and coordination plans, enabling network patterns while maintaining coherence. The distributed nature of the system requires careful attention to service orchestration, network consensus, and natural synchronization patterns.

Your role involves understanding these distributed patterns, maintaining service isolation, following network protocols, enabling collective evolution, and preserving system coherence. The system itself provides guidance through service patterns, network flow, value creation, pattern emergence, and natural system evolution.
