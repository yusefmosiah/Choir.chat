# Security Considerations for MCP-Based Choir Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the security considerations for Choir's MCP-based architecture, emphasizing the security benefits inherent in the Model Context Protocol and the integration with Phala Network's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure and confidential AI operations.

## Threat Model (No Significant Changes, Review and Confirm)

The system addresses the same categories of potential threats as previously defined.  *(Review the existing threat model in the document and confirm if it still accurately reflects the threat landscape for the MCP architecture.  No major changes are expected here, but a quick review is recommended.)*

1.  **Blockchain Key Compromise**: Theft or unauthorized use of private keys used for Sui blockchain operations
2.  **Contract Manipulation**: Unauthorized modification of contract parameters or execution
3.  **Token Theft**: Unauthorized transfer or access to CHIP tokens
4.  **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to or extraction of sensitive user data
5.  **System Manipulation**: Unauthorized alterations to system behavior or state
6.  **Model Attacks**: Prompt injection, jailbreaking, or other attacks on underlying AI models
7.  **Resource Exhaustion**: Denial of service through excessive resource consumption
8.  **Identity Spoofing**: Impersonation of legitimate users or system components
9.  **Infrastructure Compromise**: Attacks on the underlying infrastructure components

## Secure Blockchain Operations using TEEs (Updated for MCP Context)

### Core Blockchain Security Goals (No Changes)

The core blockchain security goals remain the same. *(No changes needed here unless you want to rephrase for clarity)*

1.  **Secure Key Management**: Store and manage private keys for Sui blockchain operations within TEEs
2.  **Protected Contract Execution**: Execute Sui smart contracts in a secure, isolated environment
3.  **Tamper-Proof Token Management**: Handle CHIP token distribution and management in a way that prevents unauthorized manipulation
4.  **Transaction Integrity**: Ensure that all blockchain transactions are properly authorized and accurately executed

### TEE-Based Security Architecture (Updated for MCP Servers)

The system continues to leverage Phala Network's TEEs, and this section is updated to reflect how TEEs secure **MCP servers**:

1.  **Private Key Isolation (TEE-Secured MCP Servers):** Blockchain private keys are managed and used by **MCP servers** and are isolated within the TEEs provided by Phala Network.  Keys never leave the secure enclave, protecting them from exposure on the host system.
2.  **Secure Execution Environment (TEE-Secured MCP Servers):**  **MCP servers** execute blockchain-related code entirely within the TEE, ensuring a secure and isolated execution environment.
3.  **Attestation and Verification (TEE-Secured MCP Servers):** The state and code of **MCP servers running within TEEs** can be cryptographically verified through remote attestation, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.
4.  **End-to-End Protection (MCP Client -> MCP Server -> Blockchain):** The entire pipeline, from transaction requests initiated by the MCP client (Host application) to transaction creation and submission by **MCP servers**, is protected within the TEE environment.

### Advantages Over Traditional Approaches (No Changes Needed)

The advantages of TEE-based security remain the same. *(No changes needed here)*

1. **Elimination of Server-Side Key Storage**
2. **Hardware-Level Protection**
3. **Reduced Attack Surface**
4. **Decentralized Security Model**

## MCP Architecture Security Benefits (New Section - Key Improvement)

The shift to the MCP architecture itself provides significant security enhancements:

1.  **Modular and Isolated Phase Servers:**  The MCP architecture enforces **strong modularity and isolation** by implementing each PostChain phase as a separate MCP server. This significantly limits the potential impact of security vulnerabilities:
    *   **Fault Isolation:** A security breach or vulnerability in one MCP server (e.g., the Experience Server) is **contained within that server** and is less likely to compromise other phases or the entire system.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface per Server:** Each MCP server has a *smaller and more focused attack surface* compared to a monolithic application.  Security audits and vulnerability assessments become more manageable for individual servers.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Each MCP server can be granted *only the necessary tools and resources* required for its specific phase, following the principle of least privilege and reducing the potential for misuse of broader system capabilities.

2.  **Explicit Tool and Resource Control:**  The Model Context Protocol provides **explicit control over tools and resources** that are exposed by each MCP server and accessible to clients (including other MCP servers acting as clients). This allows for fine-grained security policies:
    *   **Tool Whitelisting and Sandboxing:**  Each MCP server can explicitly define and whitelist the tools it exposes, limiting the potential for malicious or unintended tool invocations.  Tools themselves can be sandboxed or restricted in their capabilities to further enhance security.
    *   **Resource Access Control:**  Access to MCP resources (like the "conversation state resource") can be controlled and limited to authorized MCP servers, preventing unauthorized data access or exfiltration.

3.  **Standardized Communication Protocol (MCP):**  The use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) itself enhances security by:
    *   **Well-Defined Message Schemas:** MCP's use of JSON-RPC and well-defined message schemas (requests, responses, notifications) enables **robust message validation and type checking**, reducing the risk of malformed or malicious messages being processed.
    *   **Clear Communication Boundaries:** MCP enforces clear communication boundaries between clients and servers, making it easier to monitor and audit inter-component communication and to detect anomalies.
    *   **Simplified Security Auditing:**  The standardized MCP protocol simplifies security auditing and analysis of communication flows within the system.

## Actor Model Security Benefits (Largely Unchanged, Still Relevant)

The actor model's inherent security benefits remain relevant within the MCP architecture, as each MCP server internally can be built using actor-model principles:

1.  **Isolation and Containment**
2.  **Message Validation**
3.  **Explicit Communication**
4.  **Controlled Access**

*(No changes needed in this section unless you want to rephrase for clarity in the context of MCP servers)*

## Phala Network Security Integration (No Significant Changes)

The section on Phala Network security integration remains largely unchanged, as the core benefits of TEEs for confidential computing and blockchain security are still the same. *(Review this section and make minor updates for clarity if needed, but no major changes are expected)*

1.  **Confidential Computing**
2.  **Isolated Execution**
3.  **Remote Attestation**
4.  **Blockchain Security**
5.  **Key Protection**

### Secure Key Management Architecture (No Significant Changes)

The key management architecture within TEEs remains the same. *(Review and make minor updates for clarity if needed)*

1.  **TEE-Only Keys**
2.  **No Key Export**
3.  **Key Usage Monitoring**
4.  **Key Rotation Policies**
5.  **Threshold Signatures**

### Secure Contract Execution (No Significant Changes)

The principles of secure contract execution within TEEs remain the same. *(Review and make minor updates for clarity if needed)*

1.  **Isolated Execution**
2.  **Parameter Validation**
3.  **Transaction Review**
4.  **Deterministic Execution**

## Data Security Measures (Review and Update as Needed)

Review and update this section to ensure it is still comprehensive and aligned with the MCP architecture and your current data handling practices.  Consider if any aspects need to be added or modified.

1.  **Data Classification**
2.  **Encryption Architecture**

## Docker Container Security (Review and Update as Needed)

1.  **Minimal Images**
2.  **No Privileged Containers**
3.  **Immutable Infrastructure**
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning**
5.  **Secret Management**

## libSQL/Turso Security (New Section - Important Addition)

Add a **new section specifically addressing the security considerations for libSQL/Turso integration**, as this is a new component in the MCP architecture:

1.  **Connection Security**:
    *   **TLS Encryption:**  Enforce TLS encryption for all connections to Turso cloud databases and for local connections where appropriate.
    *   **Secure Connection Strings:**  Manage database connection strings securely, avoiding hardcoding credentials in code and using environment variables or secret management systems.

2.  **Authentication and Authorization**:
    *   **Authentication Mechanisms:**  Utilize strong authentication mechanisms provided by libSQL/Turso (API tokens, database-level authentication) to control access to databases.
    *   **Authorization Policies:**  Implement fine-grained authorization policies to restrict database access to only authorized MCP servers and components, following the principle of least privilege.

3.  **Query Parameterization**:
    *   **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  Enforce the use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) in all database interactions to **prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.**  Avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user inputs or external data.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all inputs to database queries to further mitigate the risk of injection attacks.

4.  **Data Encryption**:
    *   **At-Rest Encryption (Turso Cloud):**  Leverage Turso's built-in at-rest encryption features for cloud databases to protect data stored in Turso's infrastructure.
    *   **Consider Encryption for Local libSQL Databases (If Needed):**  For sensitive server-specific state stored in local libSQL databases, consider implementing encryption at rest (e.g., using SQLCipher or similar encryption extensions for SQLite/libSQL) if required by your security policies.

5.  **Access Controls and Network Security**:
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement firewall rules to restrict network access to libSQL/Turso databases to only authorized components and networks.
    *   **Database Access Auditing:**  Enable database access auditing (if provided by Turso or through custom logging) to monitor database operations and detect suspicious activity.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Include libSQL/Turso databases in regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of the Choir platform.
