# FQAHO Simulation Framework with cadCAD

VERSION fqaho_simulation: 2.0 (cadCAD Edition)

This document outlines the simulation framework for Choir's Fractional Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator (FQAHO) model, now leveraging **cadCAD** as the primary tool for rigorous modeling, parameter optimization, and validation. This guide details how to use cadCAD to simulate FQAHO dynamics, calibrate parameters, test system behavior, and generate valuable insights into the CHIP token economy.

## Simulation Objectives (No Changes - Still Relevant)

The FQAHO simulation, now implemented in cadCAD, serves the same core objectives:

1. Calibrate optimal parameter ranges and sensitivity coefficients
2. Test system response to various thread evolution scenarios
3. Verify the economic stability and fairness properties
4. Generate synthetic metadata for downstream analysis

## Parameter Framework (No Changes - Still Relevant)

The parameter framework for the FQAHO model remains the same.  *(No changes needed here, but ensure this section is clearly presented and well-explained in the updated document)*

### Fractional Parameter (α)

- **Range**: 1 < α ≤ 2
- **Interpretation**: Controls memory effects and non-local interactions
- **Modulation Formula**:
  ```
  α(t,q) = 2 - δ₁(1-e^(-t/τ)) - δ₂q
  ```
  Where t is normalized thread age, q measures quality, τ sets the time constant, and δ₁, δ₂ determine sensitivity.

### Anharmonic Coefficient (K₀)

- **Range**: 0.5 ≤ K₀ ≤ 5.0
- **Interpretation**: Represents immediate feedback sensitivity
- **Modulation Formula**:
  ```
  K₀(r,α) = K₀_base * (1 + γ₁r) * (2/α)^γ₂
  ```
Where r is the recent refusal ratio, γ₁ is refusal sensitivity, and γ₂ is the fractional coupling coefficient.

### Potential Order (m)

- **Range**: 2 ≤ m ≤ 4
- **Interpretation**: Represents network complexity and interaction depth
- **Modulation Formula**:
  ```
  m(c,n) = 2 + β₁tanh(c/c₀) + β₂log(1+n/n₀)
  ```
Where c is citation count, n is co-author count, and β₁, β₂ are scaling coefficients.

## Implementation Approach (Updated for cadCAD)

The FQAHO implementation in **cadCAD** will model the token economy as a sophisticated agent-based system.  cadCAD's capabilities will allow us to:

*   **Model Agents and Behaviors:** Represent users, AI agents (phase servers), and external actors as distinct agents with defined behaviors and strategies within the simulation.
*   **Simulate State Dynamics:**  Model the evolution of key state variables (token price, token distribution, FQAHO parameters, user reputations) over time in response to agent actions and system events.
*   **Implement Policies and Mechanisms:**  Translate the FQAHO model formulas, reward mechanisms, and economic policies into cadCAD "policies" and "mechanisms" (state update functions).
*   **Run Stochastic Simulations:**  Incorporate stochasticity and randomness into the simulation to model the inherent uncertainty and variability of real-world user behavior and market dynamics.
*   **Analyze and Visualize Results:**  Leverage cadCAD's built-in analysis and visualization tools to explore simulation data, identify patterns, and gain insights into the token economy's behavior.

The core pricing formula, implemented within the cadCAD model, remains:

```
P₀ = S₀[(2n+1)^(α/2) + (K₀λ)^{α/(m+1)}]
```

cadCAD will allow us to simulate how this formula, coupled with the dynamic parameter evolution, drives stake price dynamics and value distribution within the Choir ecosystem.

## Simulation Phases (Updated for cadCAD)

The simulation phases will now be implemented and executed using cadCAD:

### Phase 1: Parameter Isolation (cadCAD Parameter Sweeps)

- **cadCAD Implementation:** Use cadCAD's parameter sweeping capabilities to systematically vary each FQAHO parameter (α, K₀, m) while holding the others constant.
- **Simulation Runs:** Run cadCAD simulations for each parameter sweep, varying the parameter across its defined range.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze the simulation output data (token price, user engagement metrics) to observe the stake price response to changes in each isolated parameter.
- **Visualization:** Generate cadCAD visualizations (time-series plots, parameter sensitivity charts) to identify stable operating ranges and parameter sensitivities.

### Phase 2: Parameter Coupling (cadCAD Multi-Parameter Experiments)

- **cadCAD Implementation:** Design cadCAD experiments to explore the 3D parameter space (α, K₀, m) and simulate the *coupled evolution* of these parameters based on their modulation formulas.
- **Simulation Runs:** Run cadCAD simulations for various combinations of parameter values and initial conditions, exploring different regions of the 3D parameter space.

- **Visualization:** Create cadCAD visualizations (3D parameter volumes, 2D parameter slices, heatmaps) to highlight critical transition boundaries, stable operating regions, and parameter coupling effects.

### Phase 3: Dynamic Trajectories (cadCAD Agent-Based Simulations)

- **cadCAD Implementation:** Implement a full agent-based cadCAD model that simulates the dynamic evolution of threads, users, AI agents, and the token economy over time.
- **Simulation Runs:** Run cadCAD simulations to simulate thread evolution over extended time periods, incorporating:
    - User actions (prompt creation, citations, token transactions).
    - AI agent actions (reward distribution, context pruning).
    - FQAHO parameter evolution based on simulation feedback.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze the simulation output data to track parameter trajectories, price dynamics, and value distribution over time. Identify common patterns of thread evolution (e.g., "breakthrough threads," "steady contributor threads") and outliers.
- **Visualization:** Generate cadCAD animations and visualizations (thread evolution paths, price evolution curves, network graphs) to illustrate dynamic trajectories, identify pattern types, and fine-tune sensitivity coefficients for the FQAHO model.

## Test Scenarios (Updated for cadCAD Implementation)

The test scenarios will be implemented and analyzed within the cadCAD simulation framework:

1.  **New Thread Evolution (cadCAD Simulation of Thread Creation and Growth)**
    -   **cadCAD Setup:**  Initialize a new thread agent in the cadCAD simulation with initial FQAHO parameters (α ≈ 2.0, low K₀, low m).

## Visualization Techniques for cadCAD FQAHO Model Simulations

Effective visualization is paramount for gaining insights from the complex data generated by cadCAD simulations of the FQAHO model.  Visualizations are not just for presentation; they are essential **analytical tools** that help reveal hidden patterns, understand system dynamics, and communicate complex information clearly.

Here are key visualization techniques to employ when working with your cadCAD FQAHO model simulation results:

### 1. Parameter Space Mapping Visualizations

These visualizations are crucial for understanding the relationship between FQAHO parameters (α, K₀, m) and system behavior.

*   **3D Parameter Volume Plots (using Plotly or Matplotlib):**
    *   **Purpose:** To map the stability and behavior of the token economy across the 3D parameter space of (α, K₀, m).
    *   **Data to Visualize:**
        *   X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis: Represent the three FQAHO parameters (α, K₀, m).
        *   Color Mapping: Use color to represent key metrics like:
            *   **Stake Price Stability:**  Color regions of the parameter space based on the *volatility* or *stability* of the simulated CHIP token price.  Use color gradients to indicate regions of high stability (e.g., green), moderate volatility (e.g., yellow), and high volatility or instability (e.g., red).
            *   **Token Value Accrual:** Color regions based on the *long-term growth rate* of the CHIP token price in simulations.  Use color gradients to highlight regions that lead to sustainable token value accrual.
            *   **User Engagement Metrics:** Color regions based on average user engagement metrics (e.g., message creation rate, citation frequency) in simulations.
    *   **Interactive Exploration (Plotly Recommended):** Use interactive 3D plotting libraries like Plotly to create interactive visualizations that allow users to:
        *   **Rotate and Zoom:**  Rotate and zoom the 3D volume to explore different regions of the parameter space from various angles.
        *   **Slice and Section:**  Create 2D slices or sections through the 3D volume to examine specific parameter planes in more detail.
        *   **Hover and Inspect:**  Enable hover tooltips to display the exact parameter values and corresponding metrics for specific points in the 3D space.
    *   **Overlay Thread Trajectories:**  Incorporate the ability to overlay simulated "thread evolution paths" onto the 3D parameter volume.  These paths would show how FQAHO parameters evolve over time for different types of simulated threads (e.g., "breakthrough threads," "controversial threads").

*   **2D Parameter Slice Heatmaps (using Seaborn or Matplotlib):**
    *   **Purpose:** To examine the relationship between *pairs* of FQAHO parameters in more detail, while holding the third parameter constant (or slicing through the 3D volume).
    *   **Data to Visualize:**
        *   X-axis, Y-axis: Represent two of the FQAHO parameters (e.g., α vs. K₀, α vs. m, K₀ vs. m).
        *   Heatmap Color: Use a heatmap color scale to represent key metrics (stake price stability, token value accrual, user engagement) as a function of the two parameters on the axes.
        *   **Contour Lines:** Overlay contour lines on the heatmap to show lines of equal value for the chosen metric (e.g., contour lines for equal stake price levels).
    *   **Identify Critical Transition Boundaries:** Heatmaps are excellent for visually identifying *critical transition boundaries* in the parameter space – regions where small changes in parameters can lead to significant shifts in system behavior (e.g., transitions from stable to volatile token prices).

### 2. Dynamic Trajectory Visualizations

These visualizations are essential for understanding how the system evolves *over time* in cadCAD simulations.

        *   **Color-Coding:** Color-code thread evolution paths by thread type (e.g., "new thread," "mature thread," "controversial thread") or by thread quality metrics (e.g., average citation rate).
        *   **Overlay Events:** Overlay key events on the plots (e.g., user actions, citation events, policy interventions) to see how they correlate with parameter changes.
    *   **Identify Common Patterns and Outliers:**  These plots help identify common patterns in thread evolution (e.g., typical parameter trajectories for successful threads) and to spot outliers or unusual thread behaviors that warrant further investigation.

            *   **Approval/Refusal Events:** Mark points in time where simulated user approvals or refusals occur for messages within the thread.
            *   **Citation Events:** Mark points where the thread receives citations from other threads.
        *   **Highlight Price Sensitivity:** These plots help visualize how stake price *responds to* user feedback (approvals/refusals) and network effects (citations), demonstrating the dynamic price discovery mechanism of the FQAHO model.

### 3. Network Effect Visualizations

        *   Edges: Represent citations between threads (a directed edge from thread A to thread B if thread A cites thread B).
        *   Node Size/Color:  Use node size or color to represent thread-level metrics like:
            *   Stake Price: Node size or color intensity could represent the current stake price of the thread.
            *   Citation Count: Node size or color could represent the total number of citations a thread has received.
            *   Thread Quality Metrics: Node size or color could represent aggregated quality scores for the thread.
        *   Edge Thickness/Color: Use edge thickness or color to represent citation-level metrics like:
            *   Citation Value/Reward: Edge thickness or color intensity could represent the token reward associated with a citation.
            *   Citation "Salience" Score: Edge thickness or color could represent a measure of the semantic strength or importance of the citation.
    *   **Layout Algorithms (NetworkX Layouts):** Experiment with different graph layout algorithms (e.g., spring layout, force-directed layout) to find visualizations that effectively reveal the structure and patterns of the citation network.
    *   **Interactive Network Exploration (Dash or Web-Based Visualization):**  Consider creating interactive network visualizations (using Dash or web-based libraries) that allow users to:
        *   **Zoom and Pan:** Explore different parts of the network graph.
        *   **Node Hover and Inspection:** Hover over nodes to display detailed information about individual threads (metrics, parameters, example messages).
        *   **Filter and Highlight:** Filter or highlight threads based on specific criteria (e.g., threads with high stake prices, threads with many citations, threads of a certain type).

*   **Value Flow Visualizations (using Sankey Diagrams or Flow Maps):**
    *   **Purpose:** To visualize how value (CHIP tokens) flows through the Choir ecosystem and the citation network in cadCAD simulations.
    *   **Data to Visualize:**
        *   Nodes: Represent different entities in the token economy (users, AI agents, treasury, different thread categories).
        *   Edges: Represent flows of CHIP tokens between entities (user contributions, reward distributions, data purchases, staking, etc.).
        *   Edge Thickness: Edge thickness represents the *magnitude* of the value flow (e.g., thicker edges for larger token flows).
        *   Color Coding: Color-code value flows by type (e.g., green for rewards, red for costs, blue for user contributions).
    *   **Identify Key Value Flow Pathways:** Sankey diagrams or flow maps can help visually identify the *key pathways* through which value flows in the Choir ecosystem, highlighting:
        *   Which user activities generate the most value.
        *   How value is distributed and redistributed through the token economy.
        *   Potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in value flow.

Use descriptive titles, axis labels, legends, and annotations to make your visualizations understandable and informative to both technical and non-technical audiences.
*   **Colorblind-Friendly Palettes (Accessibility):**  When choosing color palettes for heatmaps and other visualizations, consider using colorblind-friendly palettes to ensure your visualizations are accessible to everyone.

By implementing these visualization techniques, you'll be able to unlock the full potential of your cadCAD FQAHO model simulations, gain deep insights into the dynamics of the CHIP token economy, and communicate your findings effectively to a wider audience.  Visualizations are not just "pretty pictures" – they are essential tools for understanding and building truly complex and innovative AI-driven systems like Choir.
