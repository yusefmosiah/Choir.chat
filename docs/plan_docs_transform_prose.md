# Documentation Transform Fluid Prose

VERSION transform_to_prose: 1.0

Our documentation requires higher signal-to-noise ratio. Pseudocode, which sits awkwardly between theory and implementation, dilutes precision. Structural markers and lists fragment understanding. Excessive quantum terminology obscures rather than illuminates. Yet the mathematical foundations - the equations and formulas that precisely describe our system's behavior - these are pure signal.

The transformation preserves what matters: version headers for identity, mathematics for precision, clear statements for insight. Everything else flows as continuous prose. Implementation details belong in code files. Theory manifests through equations and their implications. Architecture emerges through clear exposition rather than formal declaration.

This transform applies to the living documentation in our docs directory, excluding archived materials and level documentation. Each document will maintain its mathematical foundations while expressing ideas with greater clarity and less noise. When we write E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2), we mean exactly that - a precise description of energy levels in our system. The prose explores implications; the mathematics captures truth.

The result is documentation with higher fidelity. Technical precision flows from mathematical clarity and direct statement. Our system's architecture reveals itself through clean signal rather than noisy metaphor.
