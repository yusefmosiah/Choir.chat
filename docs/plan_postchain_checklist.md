# PostChain Implementation Checklist

This checklist provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the PostChain project, implementing the missing `chorus_graph.py`, resolving directory and import issues, and running the test suite. Follow each step carefully to ensure a coherent and functional integration.

---

## 1. Verify and Correct Directory Structure

- [x] Ensure the project directory follows this structure:
  ```
  Choir/
  ├── api/
  │   ├── app/
  │   │   ├── chorus_graph.py    # <-- Ensure this file exists
  │   │   └── postchain/
  │   │       ├── __init__.py
  │   │       └── schemas/
  │   │           ├── __init__.py
  │   │           ├── aeiou.py
  │   │           └── state.py
  │   └── tests/
  │       └── postchain/
  │           ├── __init__.py
  │           ├── test_cases.py
  │           ├── test_framework.py
  │           └── analysis.py
  └── tests/
      └── postchain/
          ├── __init__.py
          ├── test_cases.py
          ├── test_framework.py
          └── analysis.py
  ```
- [x] Consolidate tests into a single directory (at `api/tests/postchain`) to avoid duplication.

---

## 2. Implement the Missing `chorus_graph.py`

- [x] Create the file `api/app/chorus_graph.py` if it does not exist.
- [x] Add a minimal implementation with handlers for each phase:
  - `action_handler`
  - `experience_handler`
  - `intention_handler`
  - `observation_handler`
  - `understanding_handler` (includes looping decision logic)
  - `yield_handler`
- [x] Define edges to connect phases and use conditional edges for looping from `understanding` to either `action` or `yield`.
- [x] Looping at understanding is to be handled by a looping probability from 0 to 1. each understanding phase is parameterized by this threshold. the user and the system will be able to pass in their own probabilities to multiply. so a user signal of 0.0 or a system signal of 0.0 is looping: false.

---

## 3. Fix Import Issues in Tests

- [x] Update import statements in `tests/postchain/test_cases.py` to use absolute paths:
  ```python
  from tests.postchain.test_framework import PostChainTester
  from api.app.chorus_graph import create_chorus_graph
  ```
- [x] Ensure each test directory has an `__init__.py` file.

---

## 4. Ensure PYTHONPATH is Correct

- [x] Set the `PYTHONPATH` when running tests:
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/postchain/test_cases.py -v
  ```
- [x] Alternatively, create a `pytest.ini` at the project root with the following configuration:
  ```ini
  [pytest]
  pythonpath = .
  asyncio_mode = auto
  ```

---

## 5. Verify Dependencies

- [x] Install all necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest pytest-asyncio langgraph pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```
- [x] Ensure your virtual environment is activated and properly set up.

---

## 6. Run Your Tests

- [x] Execute the test suite using:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/postchain/test_cases.py -v
  ```

---

## 7. Confirm Coherence

- [x] Verify that the schemas exist and are correctly defined:
  - `api/app/postchain/schemas/aeiou.py` should define `AEIOUResponse`.
  - `api/app/postchain/schemas/state.py` should define `ChorusState`.
- [x] Ensure that each phase handler returns a consistent state structure.
- [x] Confirm all test cases align with the implemented handlers and schemas.

---

## 8. Final Verification and Next Steps

- [x] Run the tests and confirm they execute without errors.
- [x] Expand the handlers with real model integrations as required.
- [x] Implement detailed logging and analysis once the basic test suite is stable.
- [ ] Integrate tool binding and persistence layers in subsequent iterations.

---

## 9. Logging and Observability

- [x] Implement structured logging for each phase handler to capture:
  - Phase name
  - Input state
  - Output state
  - Confidence scores
  - Reasoning text
  - Timestamps
- [x] Ensure logs are stored in a structured format (e.g., JSONL) for easy analysis.
- [ ] Set up centralized logging infrastructure (optional but recommended for production).

## 10. Error Handling and Robustness

- [x] Define clear error handling strategies for each phase:
  - Model API failures
  - Schema validation errors
  - Unexpected state transitions
- [x] Implement graceful degradation and informative error messages for end-users.
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors.

## 11. Performance and Scalability

- [ ] Benchmark the performance of each phase individually and the entire PostChain.
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and optimize critical paths.
- [ ] Plan for future scalability (e.g., parallel processing, caching strategies).

## 12. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- [x] Document each phase handler clearly, including:
  - Purpose and responsibilities
  - Input/output schemas
  - Dependencies and external integrations
- [x] Maintain up-to-date conceptual documentation reflecting the current architecture.
- [x] Regularly update the checklist and documentation as the implementation evolves.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- [x] If you encounter import issues, double-check the `__init__.py` files and PYTHONPATH settings.
- [x] Verify directory structure carefully to resolve any ambiguity between `api/tests/postchain` and `tests/postchain`.
- [x] Monitor logs in `tests/postchain_tests.log` for detailed error and event traces.
- [x] For recursion errors, check the `recursion_limit` configuration and ensure proper loop termination.
- [x] For state consistency issues, verify that all phases correctly maintain and update the state structure.

This checklist serves as a guide to ensure your PostChain implementation and test suite are correctly structured and functional. Follow it step-by-step to address any issues and facilitate smooth integration and testing.
