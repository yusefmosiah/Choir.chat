# Core Economic Model

VERSION core_economics: 6.0

The economic model operates as a quantum anharmonic system, anchored by the Move Virtual Machine as its source of truth. The model orchestrates value flows through stake dynamics modulated by collective feedback signals.

At its foundation, the system tracks economic events through the blockchain. These events capture stake movements, anharmonic coefficient adjustments, equity distributions, and reward issuance. Each event carries a unique identifier, precise timestamp, and rich metadata that ensures perfect traceability.

The chain state manager serves as the authoritative bridge between the economic model and the blockchain. It retrieves thread economics directly from smart contracts, maintaining an accurate view of stake prices, anharmonic coefficients, token balances, and equity distributions. All economic transactions flow through this manager, ensuring that on-chain state changes trigger appropriate event cascades throughout the system.

The model's core strength lies in its quantum anharmonic calculations. The base price follows a λx²m oscillator model:

P₀ = S₀[(2n+1) + (K₀λ)^{1/(m+1)}]

Where:

- K₀ = Baseline anharmonic coefficient from QAHO theory (e.g. table 1 values), which in practice is modulated by approval/refusal statistics.
  (Higher refusal rates boost the effective K₀, thereby increasing the required stake price.)
- m = Potential order (default quartic: m = 2; sextic m = 3, etc)
- n = Excitation level (capturing thread complexity/activity)

Equity distribution follows a square root law reflecting quantum amplitude principles:

E(s) = (1/N) \* √(s/P₀)

This formula elegantly balances the number of co-authors N with the stake amount s, normalized by the base price P₀, ensuring fair value distribution across participants.

The economic handler processes these events through a carefully orchestrated flow. When stake is deposited, it calculates new equity shares based on the current anharmonic coefficient and organizational frequency. Collective feedback triggers stake price recalculations that maintain system equilibrium. Each event flows through the handler, ensuring proper economic state transitions.

Analytics and monitoring provide real-time insight into the economic system's health. The system tracks stake movements, K₀ adjustments, equity distributions, and reward issuance. This data feeds back into the system, enabling natural price discovery and value distribution.

The economic model's strength emerges from several key principles. The blockchain serves as the immutable source of truth, while value flows follow strict conservation laws. Price discovery emerges naturally through anharmonic eigenvalue patterns, and state changes propagate through quantized energy transitions. Most importantly, complex economic behaviors arise organically from these simple underlying rules.

Through this careful balance of blockchain authority, mathematical precision, and natural value flows, the economic model creates a self-sustaining ecosystem for knowledge work. The system's elegance lies in how these principles work together, creating a robust economic framework that adapts and evolves while maintaining fundamental stability.
