# Core Economic Model

VERSION core_economics: 7.0

The economic model operates as a fractional quantum anharmonic system, anchored by the Move Virtual Machine as its source of truth. The model orchestrates value flows through stake dynamics modulated by collective feedback signals and non-local memory effects.

At its foundation, the system tracks economic events through the blockchain. These events capture stake movements, parameter adjustments, equity distributions, and reward issuance. Each event carries a unique identifier, precise timestamp, and rich metadata that ensures perfect traceability.

The chain state manager serves as the authoritative bridge between the economic model and the blockchain. It retrieves thread economics directly from smart contracts, maintaining an accurate view of stake prices, model parameters, token balances, and equity distributions. All economic transactions flow through this manager, ensuring that on-chain state changes trigger appropriate event cascades throughout the system.

The model's core strength lies in its fractional quantum anharmonic calculations. The base price follows a modified FQAHO model:

P₀ = S₀[(2n+1)^(α/2) + (K₀λ)^{α/(m+1)}]

Where:

- α = Fractional parameter (1<α≤2) capturing memory effects and non-local interactions
- K₀ = Anharmonic coefficient dynamically modulated by recent approval/refusal statistics
- m = Potential order reflecting thread complexity and network depth
- n = Excitation level (capturing thread activity)

The fractional parameter α evolves according to:

α(t,q) = 2 - δ₁(1-e^(-t/τ)) - δ₂q

Where t represents normalized thread age, q measures quality through approval ratios, τ sets the time constant, and δ₁, δ₂ determine sensitivity.

Equity distribution follows a fractional square root law reflecting quantum amplitude principles:

E(s) = (1/N) \* (s/P₀)^(α/2)

This formula elegantly balances the number of co-authors N with the stake amount s, normalized by the base price P₀, ensuring fair value distribution across participants while accounting for memory effects.

The economic handler processes these events through a carefully orchestrated flow. When stake is deposited, it calculates new equity shares based on the current parameter values and organizational frequency. Collective feedback triggers parameter recalculations that maintain system equilibrium. Each event flows through the handler, ensuring proper economic state transitions.

Analytics and monitoring provide real-time insight into the economic system's health. The system tracks stake movements, parameter adjustments, equity distributions, and reward issuance. This data feeds back into the system, enabling natural price discovery and value distribution.

The economic model's strength emerges from several key principles. The blockchain serves as the immutable source of truth, while value flows follow fractional conservation laws. Price discovery emerges naturally through eigenvalue patterns of the fractional system, and state changes propagate through Lévy flight-like transitions. Most importantly, complex economic behaviors arise organically from these simple underlying rules.

Through this careful balance of blockchain authority, fractional mathematical precision, and natural value flows, the economic model creates a self-sustaining ecosystem for knowledge work. The system's elegance lies in how these principles work together, creating a robust economic framework that adapts and evolves while maintaining fundamental stability.

# Dynamic Parameter Evolution

## Fractional Parameter (α)

α(t,q) = 2 - δ₁(1-e^(-t/τ)) - δ₂q

## Anharmonic Coefficient (K₀)

K₀(r,α) = K₀*base * (1 + γ₁r) \_ (2/α)^γ₂

## Potential Order (m)

m(c,n) = 2 + β₁tanh(c/c₀) + β₂log(1+n/n₀)

## Implementation in Actor Model

```python
class EconomicActor(Actor[EconomicState]):
    async def adjust_parameters(self, thread_state: ThreadState):
        """Update FQAHO parameters based on thread activity"""
        # Calculate new α using memory decay formula
        new_alpha = 2 - self.delta1*(1 - math.exp(-thread_state.age/self.tau))
                      - self.delta2*thread_state.quality_score

        # Update thread parameters
        await self.blockchain_actor.send(
            ParameterUpdate(
                thread_id=thread_state.id,
                alpha=new_alpha,
                k0=calculate_new_k0(thread_state.refusal_rate),
                m=calculate_new_m(thread_state.citation_count)
            )
        )
```
