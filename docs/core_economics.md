# Core Economic Model

VERSION core_economics: 6.0

The economic model operates as a harmonically balanced system, anchored by the Move Virtual Machine as its source of truth. The model orchestrates the flow of value through temperature-mediated stake dynamics and equitable distribution mechanisms.

At its foundation, the system tracks economic events through the blockchain. These events capture stake movements, temperature fluctuations, equity distributions, and reward issuance. Each event carries a unique identifier, precise timestamp, and rich metadata that ensures perfect traceability.

The chain state manager serves as the authoritative bridge between the economic model and the blockchain. It retrieves thread economics directly from smart contracts, maintaining an accurate view of temperature, energy levels, token balances, and equity distributions. All economic transactions flow through this manager, ensuring that on-chain state changes trigger appropriate event cascades throughout the system.

The model's core strength lies in its harmonic calculations. These pure mathematical functions govern the relationship between temperature and value. The base price follows a quantum harmonic oscillator model:

P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

In this equation, S₀ represents the base stake quantum, while ℏ denotes the reduced Planck constant. The frequency ω interacts with the Boltzmann constant k and temperature T to determine the system's energy state.

Equity distribution follows a square root law that balances stake size with fair co-author allocation:

E(s) = (1/N) * √(s/P₀)

This formula elegantly balances the number of co-authors N with the stake amount s, normalized by the base price P₀, ensuring fair value distribution across participants.

The economic handler processes these events through a carefully orchestrated flow. When stake is deposited, it calculates new equity shares based on the current temperature and frequency. Temperature changes trigger chain updates that maintain the system's thermodynamic balance. Each event flows through the handler, ensuring proper economic state transitions.

Analytics and monitoring provide real-time insight into the economic system's health. The system tracks stake movements, temperature evolution, equity distributions, and reward issuance. This data feeds back into the system, enabling natural price discovery and value distribution.

The economic model's strength emerges from several key principles. The blockchain serves as the immutable source of truth, while value flows follow strict conservation laws. Price discovery emerges naturally through harmonic oscillator patterns, and state changes propagate cleanly through the event-driven system. Most importantly, complex economic behaviors arise organically from these simple underlying rules.

Through this careful balance of blockchain authority, mathematical precision, and natural value flows, the economic model creates a self-sustaining ecosystem for knowledge work. The system's elegance lies in how these principles work together, creating a robust economic framework that adapts and evolves while maintaining fundamental stability.
