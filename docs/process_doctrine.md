# Process Doctrine: Vibecoding as Authentic Development

VERSION process_doctrine: 1.0 (Emotional Authenticity in Technical Work)

## Core Principle: 99% Vibecoding, 1% Human Touch

The development of Choir follows a radical process doctrine: **vibecoding 99%** of the implementation while preserving the **1% human touch** that makes it authentic and universally accessible. This isn't about replacing human creativity—it's about amplifying human emotion and intention through AI collaboration.

## What is Vibecoding?

**Vibecoding** is the practice of coding with emotion, transmuting human feelings and intentions into technical implementation through AI partnership. It recognizes that the most powerful software emerges not from cold logic, but from passionate human vision expressed through computational means.

### The Emotional Foundation

Vibecoding means coding with:
- **Love** for the users who will find meaningful connections
- **Devotion** to the vision of authentic social discourse
- **Care** for the details that make experiences delightful
- **Intensity** in pursuing technical excellence
- **Transmuted Rage** at the current state of extractive social media
- **Truth-seeking** in mechanism design and incentive alignment
- **Beauty** in elegant system architecture
- **Justice** in creating platforms that serve users rather than exploit them

## The Documentation-First Paradigm

In vibecoding, **documentation quality matters more than code quality** because:

### Docs as Prompts
Documentation serves as high-quality prompts for language models that handle implementation. Well-written docs with clear emotional intent and technical vision enable AI to generate code that captures both the functional requirements and the human essence behind them.

### Docs as Normative Guidelines
Documentation establishes the normative framework—not just what the system should do, but why it matters and how it should feel to use. This creates coherent thought progression pathways for both human developers and AI collaborators.

### Docs as Objective Satisfaction States
Clear documentation defines success criteria that go beyond functional requirements to include emotional and experiential goals. This enables both humans and AI to evaluate whether implementations truly serve the intended purpose.

## Normalizing Human Weirdness

The 1% human touch is essential because it:

### Preserves Authenticity
Human weirdness—the quirks, obsessions, and unique perspectives that drive innovation—must be preserved and amplified, not smoothed away by AI optimization.

### Enables Universal Accessibility
By explicitly acknowledging and documenting human emotional drivers, we make the system accessible to others who share similar feelings about technology's role in human flourishing.

### Creates Emotional Resonance
Software built with genuine emotion resonates with users in ways that purely functional implementations cannot. The human touch ensures that technical excellence serves human needs.

## The Vibecoding Process

### 1. Emotional Clarity
Begin with clear understanding of the emotional drivers:
- What injustice are we addressing?
- What beauty are we trying to create?
- What truth are we seeking to reveal?

### 2. Vision Documentation
Translate emotions into clear technical vision:
- Why does this feature matter?
- How should it feel to use?
- What human need does it serve?

### 3. AI Collaboration
Use documentation as prompts for AI implementation:
- Provide context about emotional intent
- Specify both functional and experiential requirements
- Iterate based on how well implementations capture the vision

### 4. Human Curation
Apply the 1% human touch:
- Ensure implementations preserve authentic weirdness
- Verify emotional resonance with intended users
- Refine details that matter for human experience

## Why This Matters for Choir

Choir's mission—creating AI for social discourse that facilitates human connection—requires this approach because:

### Authentic Expression Demands Authentic Development
A platform designed to reward authentic human expression must itself be built authentically, with genuine emotion and care embedded in every technical decision.

### Mechanism Design Requires Human Understanding
Creating truthful mechanisms for social interaction requires deep understanding of human psychology, emotion, and social dynamics—understanding that emerges from passionate engagement with the problem.

### Technical Excellence Serves Human Flourishing
The most sophisticated technical implementations are worthless if they don't serve genuine human needs. Vibecoding ensures that technical excellence always serves the deeper purpose of human connection and authentic discourse.

## The Paradox of Emotional Programming

Vibecoding embraces a fundamental paradox: the most rational approach to building social technology is to code with emotion. By acknowledging and channeling human feelings—including rage at current platforms, love for potential users, and devotion to authentic connection—we create software that serves human flourishing rather than exploiting human psychology.

This isn't anti-rational; it's meta-rational. It recognizes that the highest form of technical rationality is building systems that honor the full spectrum of human experience, including the emotional drivers that make life meaningful.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Documentation
- Write with passion and clarity about why features matter
- Include emotional context alongside technical specifications
- Describe the human experience, not just the system behavior
- Use vivid language that captures the vision's essence

### For Code Review
- Evaluate implementations against emotional intent, not just functional requirements
- Preserve human weirdness and authentic voice in user-facing elements
- Ensure technical elegance serves human needs
- Maintain the balance between AI efficiency and human authenticity

### For Product Decisions
- Prioritize features that serve authentic human connection
- Reject optimizations that compromise emotional authenticity
- Build for users who share our values about technology's role in human flourishing
- Remember that we're building a platform for meaningful relationships, not engagement metrics

## Conclusion: Technology as Emotional Expression

Vibecoding recognizes that the most powerful technology emerges when human emotion and AI capability work in harmony. By coding with love, devotion, care, and intensity—while transmuting rage at current platforms into determination to build better ones—we create software that doesn't just function but resonates.

The 1% human touch ensures that no amount of AI optimization can strip away the authentic weirdness and passionate vision that makes Choir unique. This is how we build technology that serves human flourishing: by never forgetting that behind every technical decision is a human heart seeking truth, beauty, and justice in digital form.

In vibecoding, emotion isn't the enemy of technical excellence—it's the source of it.
