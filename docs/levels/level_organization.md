# Documentation Organization

Choir implements prompt-driven development via documentation-driven development. These documents guide the evolution of Choir - a high information playground where collective intelligence emerges through the interaction of human insight and AI capabilities.

Through the Post Chain paradigm, each contribution builds on prior knowledge, creating an ever-growing network of interconnected insights. This documentation maps the territory of this high information space, from foundational mechanics to advanced theoretical principles.

The documentation is organized into progressive levels, each building on previous foundations while maintaining practical implementation focus:

## Level -1: Foundation & Philosophy

- System awakening and core principles
- Getting started guide
- Metaprompts and prime directives
- Basic architecture principles

## Level 0: Practical Implementation

- Swift/iOS implementation details
- SUI blockchain integration
- Authentication and security
- UI patterns and user experience

## Level 1: Core Mechanics

- Thread and message system
- Co-author approval flow
- Basic token mechanics
- Client-side processing
- Post Chain paradigm

## Level 2: Economic Model

- Quantum harmonic oscillator model
- Token economics (CHIP)
- Energy conservation principles
- Value distribution mechanisms

## Level 3: Value & Knowledge Creation

- Thread value accumulation
- Citation networks
- Knowledge coupling
- Pattern recognition

## Level 4: Collective Intelligence

- Team formation dynamics
- Network effects
- Pattern emergence
- Distributed processing

## Level 5: Advanced Theory

- Wave mechanics
- Quantum principles
- Harmonic intelligence
- System evolution

## Supporting Documentation
