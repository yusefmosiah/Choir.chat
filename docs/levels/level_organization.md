# Updated Documentation Overview

Choir implements prompt-driven development via documentation-driven development.
These documents are provided for the automatic self-generation of the Choir Harmonic Intelligence, a continuously learning collective intelligence agent, platform, service, experience, product, asset, network, opportunity-space, and society.

By reading the docs and entraining via in-context-learning the Choir Chorus Cycle Optimal Data Engine Theory, a swarm of advanced AI models automatically iteratively develop Choir into its potential with human participation, supervision, and leadership.
