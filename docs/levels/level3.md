# Anonymity by Default: A Core Principle of Choir

VERSION anonymity_by_default: 7.0

Anonymity is not just a feature of Choir; it's a fundamental principle, a design choice that shapes the platform's architecture and informs its values. By making anonymity the default state for all users, Choir prioritizes privacy, freedom of expression, and the creation of a space where ideas are judged on their merits, not on the identity of their author.

**Core Tenets:**

1. **Privacy as a Fundamental Right:** Choir recognizes that privacy is a fundamental human right, essential for individual autonomy and freedom of thought. Anonymity protects users from surveillance, discrimination, and the potential chilling effects of being constantly identified and tracked online.
2. **Freedom of Expression:** Anonymity fosters a space where users can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or reprisal. This is particularly important for discussing sensitive topics, challenging প্রচলিত norms, or exploring unconventional ideas.
3. **Focus on Ideas, Not Identities:** By separating ideas from their authors, anonymity encourages users to evaluate contributions based on their intrinsic value, rather than on the reputation or status of the contributor. This promotes a more meritocratic and intellectually rigorous environment.
4. **Protection from Bias:** Anonymity can help to mitigate the effects of unconscious bias, such as those based on gender, race, or other personal characteristics. It allows ideas to be judged on their own merits, rather than through the lens of preconceived notions about the author.
5. **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Anonymity makes it easier for new users to join the platform and start contributing, as they don't need to go through a complex verification process or share personal information.

**How Anonymity Works on Choir:**

- **Default State:** All users are anonymous by default upon joining the platform. They can interact, contribute content, and earn CHIP tokens without revealing their real-world identity.
- **Unique Identifiers:** Users are assigned unique, randomly generated identifiers that allow them to build a consistent presence on the platform without compromising their anonymity.
- **No Personal Data Collection:** Choir does not collect or store any personally identifiable information about anonymous users.
- **"Priors" and Anonymity:** The "priors" system, which shows the lineage of ideas, maintains anonymity by design. It reveals the connections between ideas, not the identities of the individuals who proposed them.

**Balancing Anonymity with Accountability:**

- **CHIP Staking:** The requirement to stake CHIP tokens to post new messages acts as a deterrent against spam and malicious behavior, even for anonymous users.
- **Community Moderation:** The platform relies on community moderation to maintain the quality of discourse and address any issues that arise.
- **Reputation Systems:** While users are anonymous by default, they can still build reputations based on the quality of their contributions, as tracked through the "priors" system and potentially through community ratings.

**The Value of Anonymity in a High-Information Environment:**

- **Encourages Honest Discourse:** Anonymity can encourage more honest and open discussions, particularly on sensitive or controversial topics.
- **Promotes Intellectual Risk-Taking:** Users may be more willing to take intellectual risks and explore unconventional ideas when they are not worried about the potential repercussions for their personal or professional lives.
- **Facilitates Whistleblowing and Dissent:** Anonymity can provide a safe space for whistleblowers and those who wish to express dissenting views without fear of retaliation.
- **Protects Vulnerable Users:** Anonymity can be particularly important for users in marginalized or vulnerable communities who may face risks if their identities are revealed.

**Conclusion:**

Anonymity by default is a core design principle of Choir, one that reflects the platform's commitment to privacy, freedom of expression, and the creation of a truly meritocratic space for the exchange of ideas. It's a bold choice in a world where online platforms increasingly demand real-name identification, but it's a choice that has the potential to unlock new levels of creativity, honesty, and collective intelligence. By prioritizing anonymity, Choir is not just building a platform; it's building a new model for online interaction, one that empowers individuals and fosters a more open and equitable exchange of ideas.

# Plan: Building a cadCAD Model for the CHIP Token Economy

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a comprehensive cadCAD model of the CHIP token economy and the Fractional Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator (FQAHO) model that underpins it. This model will serve as a "virtual lab" for simulating, testing, and optimizing the token economy before and during the Choir platform's development and evolution.

## Core Objectives of the cadCAD Model

1.  **Validate FQAHO Model Dynamics:**  Rigorous testing and validation of the FQAHO model's behavior under various conditions and parameter settings.
2.  **Optimize Tokenomics Parameters:**  Fine-tune the parameters of the CHIP token economy (reward formulas, FQAHO parameters, inflation rates, etc.) to achieve desired outcomes (sustainable token value, incentivized user behaviors, equitable distribution).
3.  **Stress Test for Gaming and Collusion:**  Simulate potential attack vectors and gaming strategies to assess the token economy's resilience and identify vulnerabilities.
4.  **Explore Different Economic Policies and Interventions:**  Model the impact of various economic policies and interventions (e.g., governance decisions, parameter adjustments, reward modifications) on the token economy.
5.  **Generate Data for Visualization and Communication:**  Create simulation data that can be used to generate compelling visualizations and documentation to communicate the token economy's dynamics to users, developers, and investors.

## cadCAD Model Components and Scope

The cadCAD model will encompass the following key components of the CHIP token economy and Choir platform:

1.  **Agents:**
    *   **Human Users:** Model different types of human users with varying behaviors and strategies:
        *   Content Creators: Users who generate prompts and messages.
        *   Curators/Citators: Users who evaluate and cite valuable contributions.
        *   Token Holders: Users who hold and trade CHIP tokens.
        *   "Gamers": Users who attempt to game or exploit the reward system.
    *   **AI Agents (Simplified Phase Servers):** Represent simplified versions of the key MCP phase servers (especially Understanding and Yield Servers) that:
        *   Algorithmically distribute novelty and citation rewards.
        *   Potentially participate in the token economy themselves (e.g., earning tokens, using tokens for resources).
    *   **External Actors (Simplified):**  Model simplified representations of external market forces or actors that can influence the CHIP token price or ecosystem dynamics (e.g., "market makers," "speculators").

2.  **State Variables:**
    *   **CHIP Token State:**
        *   Total supply, circulating supply, token distribution among users and AI agents.
        *   Token price (even if starting with a simplified price model, can be refined later).
        *   Treasury balance and token reserves.
    *   **User State:**
        *   Token balances, reputation scores (if implemented), activity levels (prompts created, citations given, etc.).
        *   User "strategies" or behavioral models (even if simplified initially).
    *   **Thread State:**
        *   FQAHO parameters (α, K₀, m) for each thread.
        *   Stake price for each thread.
        *   Message history and citation network within threads (simplified representation).
        *   "Quality scores" or metrics for threads (based on novelty, citations, user engagement).
    *   **Global System State:**
        *   Overall system health metrics (e.g., token velocity, Gini coefficient of token distribution, average user engagement).
        *   Key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Choir platform (e.g., content creation rate, citation density, user growth).

3.  **Policies (Agent Actions and Behaviors):**
    *   **User Policies:**
        *   `create_prompt_policy`:  Model user behavior in creating prompts (frequency, novelty, quality - even if these are initially simplified).
        *   `cite_message_policy`: Model user behavior in citing messages (citation frequency, citation targets, "quality" of citations - initially simplified).
        *   `trade_chip_policy`: Model user behavior in buying and selling CHIP tokens (trading frequency, price sensitivity, basic trading strategies).
        *   `game_reward_system_policy`: Model "gamer" agents attempting to exploit or game the reward system (Sybil attacks, citation cartels, etc.).
    *   **AI Agent (Phase Server) Policies:**
        *   `distribute_novelty_rewards_policy`: Implement the algorithm for AI agents (Understanding/Yield Servers) to distribute novelty rewards based on defined metrics.
        *   `distribute_citation_rewards_policy`: Implement the algorithm for AI agents to distribute citation rewards based on citation salience metrics and FQAHO parameters.
        *   `adjust_fqaho_parameters_policy`: Implement the FQAHO parameter evolution formulas (α, K₀, m) based on system feedback and thread characteristics.

4.  **Mechanisms (State Update Functions):**
    *   **Token Issuance and Distribution Mechanisms:** Implement mechanisms for:
        *   Issuing CHIP tokens as novelty rewards.
        *   Distributing CHIP tokens as citation rewards.
        *   (Optional) Token burning or deflationary mechanisms.
    *   **Token Price Dynamics Mechanisms:** Implement a simplified model for CHIP token price dynamics (you can start with a basic supply-demand model or a simplified AMM simulation, and refine it later).
    *   **FQHO Parameter Evolution Mechanisms:** Implement the FQAHO parameter evolution formulas as cadCAD state update functions, ensuring they are correctly linked to user actions and system feedback.
    *   **State Persistence and Initialization Mechanisms:** Define how the cadCAD simulation state is initialized, persisted, and reset for different simulation runs.

## Simulation Scenarios and Experiments

The cadCAD model will be used to run various simulation scenarios and experiments to:

1.  **Baseline Scenario (Organic Growth):**  Simulate the token economy under "normal" conditions with a mix of different user types and AI agent behaviors, without any external shocks or attacks.  Establish a baseline for comparison.
2.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:**  Perform parameter sweeps to systematically vary key parameters of the FQAHO model, reward formulas, and user behaviors to understand their impact on token price, user engagement, and ecosystem health.  Identify sensitive parameters and optimal parameter ranges.
3.  **Gaming and Collusion Stress Tests:**  Simulate various gaming and collusion scenarios (Sybil attacks, citation cartels, etc.) to assess the token economy's resilience and identify vulnerabilities.  Test the effectiveness of anti-gaming mechanisms.
4.  **Economic Policy Interventions:**  Simulate the impact of different economic policy interventions (e.g., changes to reward formulas, inflation rates, governance decisions) on the token economy.  Explore how governance can be used to steer the ecosystem towards desired outcomes.
5.  **"Black Swan" Event Simulations:**  Simulate extreme or unexpected events (e.g., sudden surge in user activity, market crashes, AI model failures) to test the token economy's robustness and resilience to shocks.

## Deliverables and Documentation

The key deliverables of the cadCAD modeling effort will be:

1.  **cadCAD Model Code (Python):**  A well-documented and modular Python codebase implementing the cadCAD model of the CHIP token economy.
2.  **Simulation Data and Results:**  Data files (CSV, JSON, etc.) containing the results of various simulation runs and experiments.
3.  **Visualizations and Dashboards:**  Interactive visualizations and dashboards (using Plotly, Dash, or similar tools) to explore and analyze simulation data.
4.  **Technical Documentation (Paper/Website):**  A comprehensive technical document (paper or website) that explains:
    *   The cadCAD model design and implementation.
    *   The FQAHO model and token economy principles.
    *   The simulation scenarios and experiments conducted.
    *   Key findings and insights from the simulations.
    *   Recommendations for token economy parameter settings and governance policies based on simulation results.

# libSQL Integration Plan for Choir: Expanded Role Across Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the expanded integration plan for libSQL/Turso within the Choir platform, highlighting its use not only for MCP server-specific state persistence but also for **local data storage within the Swift client application**.  This document clarifies how libSQL/Turso fits into the overall Choir architecture alongside Qdrant (for vector database) and Sui (for blockchain), creating a multi-layered data persistence strategy.

## Core Objectives (Expanded Scope for libSQL/Turso)

1.  **libSQL for Server-Specific State Persistence (MCP Servers):** Utilize libSQL as the primary solution for local persistence of server-specific data within each MCP server (phase server), enabling efficient caching and server-local data management.
2.  **libSQL for Client-Side Data Storage (Swift Client):** Integrate libSQL into the Swift client application (iOS app) to provide **local, on-device data storage** for user data, conversation history, and application settings, enabling offline functionality and improved data management within the mobile client.
3.  **Flexible Schema Across Client and Servers:** Design flexible libSQL schemas that can accommodate the evolving data models in both MCP servers and the Swift client application, ensuring adaptability and maintainability.
4.  **Complementary to Qdrant and Sui:** Clearly define the distinct roles of libSQL/Turso, Qdrant, and Sui within the Choir stack, emphasizing how libSQL/Turso complements these technologies rather than replacing them.
5.  **Simplify for MVP Scope (Focus on Essential Functionalities):** Focus the libSQL integration plan on the essential database functionalities needed for the MVP in both MCP servers and the Swift client, deferring more advanced features like multi-device sync or advanced quantization to later phases.

## Revised Implementation Plan (Expanded libSQL Role)

### 1. libSQL for MCP Server-Specific State Persistence (Detailed)

*   **Embedded libSQL in Each MCP Server (Phase Servers):**  Each MCP server (Action Server, Experience Server, etc.) will embed a lightweight libSQL database instance for managing its *server-specific state*.
*   **Server-Specific State Schema (Flexible and Minimal):** Design a flexible and minimal libSQL schema for server-specific state, focusing on common use cases like caching and temporary data storage.  Example schema (generic cache and server state tables):

    ```sql
    -- Generic cache table for MCP servers (reusable across servers)
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS server_cache (
        key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Cache key (e.g., URI, query parameters)
        value BLOB,          -- Cached data (can be text, JSON, binary)
        timestamp INTEGER     -- Timestamp of cache entry
    );

    -- Server-specific state table (example - Experience Server - customizable per server)
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS experience_server_state (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        last_sync_time INTEGER,
        # ... add server-specific state fields as needed ...
    );
    ```

*   **MCP Server SDK Utilities for libSQL Access:**  Provide utility functions and helper classes within the MCP Server SDK (Python, TypeScript, etc.) to simplify common libSQL operations within server code (as outlined in the previous `docs/3-implementation/state_management_patterns.md` update).

### 2. libSQL for Client-Side Data Storage (Swift Client Application)

*   **Embedded libSQL in Swift iOS Client:** Integrate the libSQL Swift SDK directly into the iOS client application. This embedded database will be used for:
    *   **Local Conversation History Persistence:** Storing the full conversation history (messages, user prompts, AI responses) locally on the user's device, enabling offline access to past conversations and a seamless user experience even without a network connection.
    *   **User Settings and Preferences:** Persisting user-specific settings, preferences, and application state locally on the device.
    *   **Client-Side Caching (Optional):**  Potentially using libSQL for client-side caching of resources or data fetched from MCP servers to improve app responsiveness and reduce network traffic (though HTTP caching mechanisms might be more appropriate for HTTP-based resources).
*   **Swift Client-Side Schema (Conversation History and User Data):** Design a libSQL schema within the Swift client application to efficiently store and manage:

    ```sql
    -- Client-Side Conversation History Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversation_history (
        id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique conversation ID
        title TEXT,           -- Conversation title
        created_at INTEGER,   -- Creation timestamp
        updated_at INTEGER    -- Last updated timestamp
    );

    -- Client-Side Messages Table (within each conversation)
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
        id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        conversation_id TEXT,
        role TEXT,             -- "user" or "assistant"
        content TEXT,          -- Message content
        timestamp INTEGER,     -- Message timestamp
        # ... other message-specific metadata ...
        FOREIGN KEY(conversation_id) REFERENCES conversation_history(id)
    );

    -- Client-Side User Settings Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_settings (
        setting_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        setting_value TEXT     -- Store setting values as TEXT or JSON
    );
    ```

*   **Swift Data Services for libSQL Access:** Create Swift data service classes or modules within the iOS client application to provide clean and abstracted APIs for accessing and manipulating data in the local libSQL database (e.g., `ConversationHistoryService`, `UserSettingsService`).

### 3. Vector Search (Qdrant for Global Knowledge, libSQL - Optional and Limited)

*   **Qdrant Remains the Primary Vector Database (Global Knowledge Base):**  **Qdrant remains the primary vector database solution for Choir**, used for the global knowledge base, semantic search in the Experience phase, and long-term storage of vector embeddings for messages and other content.  Qdrant's scalability, feature richness, and performance are essential for handling the large-scale vector search requirements of the Choir platform.
*   **libSQL Vector Search - *Optional* for Highly Localized Client-Side Features (Consider Sparingly):**  While libSQL offers vector search capabilities, **consider using libSQL vector search *sparingly* and only for *highly localized, client-side features* where a lightweight, embedded vector search is truly beneficial.**  For most vector search needs, especially those related to the global knowledge base and the Experience phase, Qdrant is the more appropriate and scalable solution.  Over-reliance on libSQL vector search could limit scalability and performance in the long run.

### 4. Synchronization Management (Simplified for MVP - Focus on Local Data, Cloud Sync - Future)

*   **No Multi-Device Sync for MVP (Defer):** Multi-device synchronization of conversation history or server state via Turso cloud sync is **explicitly deferred for the MVP**.
*   **Local Persistence as MVP Focus:** The primary goal of libSQL integration for the MVP is to provide **robust local persistence** in both MCP servers and the Swift client application.
*   **Cloud Backup and Sync via Turso - Future Roadmap Item:** Cloud backup and multi-device sync via Turso (or other cloud sync mechanisms) remain valuable **future roadmap items** to be considered in later phases, to enhance user data portability and accessibility across devices.

## Phased Implementation Approach (libSQL Integration - Expanded)

The phased approach to libSQL integration now encompasses both MCP servers and the Swift client:

### Phase 1: Core UX and Workflow (No Database Dependency - Current Focus)

- Continue developing the core UI and PostChain workflow, minimizing dependencies on databases for initial prototyping and UX validation.

### Phase 2: Basic libSQL Integration - Server-Side State Persistence (MVP Phase)

- Implement libSQL integration in MCP servers for server-specific state persistence and caching (as outlined in the previous plan).

### Phase 3: libSQL Integration - Swift Client-Side Persistence (MVP Phase)

- Integrate libSQL into the Swift client application for local conversation history and user settings persistence.
- Create Swift data services to manage client-side libSQL database access.

### Phase 4: (Optional) Vector Search Integration (MVP or Post-MVP - Re-evaluated)

- Re-evaluate the need for vector search in libSQL for the MVP. If deemed essential for a simplified MVP Experience phase, implement basic libSQL vector search.
- Otherwise, defer vector search implementation to post-MVP phases and plan for Qdrant integration for scalable vector search.

### Phase 5: (Future) Advanced libSQL Features and Cloud Sync

- In later phases, explore and implement more advanced libSQL/Turso features, including cloud sync, multi-device support, and potential performance optimizations.

# Postchain Data Architecture Refactoring Plan

**Core Goal:** Evolve Postchain from a purely LLM-driven tool-using workflow to a more structured process with programmatic data handling (vectorization, storage), integrated reward mechanisms, and advanced data representations (hypergraphs), while also enabling flexible model selection.

**Priorities (Re-ordered):**

1.  **Programmatic Vectorization & Storage:** Embed/store every message in Qdrant with metadata.
2.  **SUI Rewards:** Implement Novelty and Citation rewards.
3.  **Experience Phase Refactor:** Split into Qdrant search then Web search.
4.  **Hypergraph Integration:** Use `hypernetx` for user/thread graphs.
5.  **Client Model Config:** Allow SwiftUI client to select models/providers via API.

---

## Detailed Plan

### Priority 1: Programmatic Vectorization & Storage

*   **Objective:** Automatically embed and store every user query and AI response (from all phases) in Qdrant with detailed metadata (thread_id, author_id, phase, model, provider, timestamp).
*   **Rationale:** Ensures all conversational steps are captured for context retrieval, analysis, and reward calculation, independent of LLM tool calls.
*   **Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant WF as Workflow Manager
        participant LU as Langchain Utils
        participant DB as DatabaseClient
        participant Q as Qdrant

        WF->>LU: get_embedding(text)
        LU-->>WF: vector
        WF->>DB: save_message(content, vector, metadata)
        DB->>Q: upsert(point with payload including metadata)
        Q-->>DB: Success
        DB-->>WF: Success (ID)
    ```
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Embedding Utility:**
        *   In `api/app/langchain_utils.py`, create a reusable async function `get_embedding(text: str, config: Config) -> List[float]`.
        *   This function should initialize `OpenAIEmbeddings(model=config.EMBEDDING_MODEL)` and call `aembed_query(text)`.
    2.  **Workflow Integration:**
        *   In `api/app/postchain/langchain_workflow.py`:
            *   Ensure a `DatabaseClient` instance is available within `run_langchain_postchain_workflow`.
            *   **User Query:** Before the Action phase, call `get_embedding` on the input `query`. Call `db_client.save_message` with the vector and metadata: `{ "thread_id": thread_id, "author_id": "user", "phase": "input", "timestamp": datetime.now(UTC).isoformat() }`.
            *   **AI Responses:** In *each* phase function (`run_action_phase`, `run_experience_phase`, etc.), after receiving a valid `AIMessage` response:
                *   Call `get_embedding` on `response.content`.
                *   Construct metadata: `{ "thread_id": thread_id, "author_id": "ai", "phase": "<phase_name>", "model": model_config.model_name, "provider": model_config.provider, "timestamp": datetime.now(UTC).isoformat() }`.
                *   Call `db_client.save_message` with the content, vector, and metadata.
                *   Add error handling for the save operation.
    3.  **Metadata Retrieval (Enhancement):**
        *   In `api/app/database.py`, modify `DatabaseClient.search_similar` to return the full nested `metadata` dictionary from the Qdrant payload.
        *   Consider adding parameters to `search_similar` or creating new search methods (e.g., `search_with_filter`) to allow filtering points based on metadata fields like `thread_id`, `phase`, `author_id`. This will be useful for rewards and context retrieval.

### Priority 2: SUI Rewards

*   **Objective:** Implement Novelty (semantic similarity-based) and Citation rewards using SUI tokens minted via `SuiService`.
*   **Rationale:** Incentivizes valuable contributions within the conversation flow.
*   **Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[AI Message Saved in Qdrant] --> B{Calculate Novelty}
        B --> C[Search Qdrant for Similar in Thread]
        C --> D[Calculate Score (1 - max_sim)]
        D --> E[Determine Reward Amount]
        E --> F[Get User Wallet Address]
        F --> G[Mint Novelty Reward via SuiService]

        H[Experience Phase Completes w/ Tools] --> I{Calculate Citation Reward}
        I --> J[Determine Reward Amount (Default 1)]
        J --> K[Get User Wallet Address]
        K --> L[Mint Citation Reward via SuiService]

        M[DatabaseClient] --> C
        N[SuiService] --> G
        N --> L
    ```
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Workflow Integration:**
        *   In `api/app/postchain/langchain_workflow.py`:
            *   Ensure `SuiService` and `DatabaseClient` instances are available.
            *   Define a helper function `get_user_wallet(user_id: str) -> Optional[str]` (implementation TBD - needs user data source).
    2.  **Novelty Reward:**
        *   After the `db_client.save_message` call for an AI response (from Priority 1):
            *   Use the response's vector to call `db_client.search_similar` (or the enhanced version with filtering) to find the most similar message *within the same `thread_id`* excluding the message just saved.
            *   Calculate `novelty_score = 1.0 - result[0].score` if results exist, else `1.0`.
            *   Define `NOVELTY_BASE_REWARD` (e.g., 1 CHOIR = 1_000_000_000).
            *   `reward_amount = int(NOVELTY_BASE_REWARD * novelty_score)`.
            *   Get `recipient_address = await get_user_wallet(user_id)` (Need to determine `user_id` context).
            *   If address found and `reward_amount > 0`, call `await sui_service.mint_choir(recipient_address, reward_amount)`.
            *   Log the reward transaction details or errors.
    3.  **Citation Reward:**
        *   In `run_experience_phase`, after the final LLM call:
            *   Check if `web_results` or `vector_results` in the `ExperiencePhaseOutput` are non-empty.
            *   If yes, define `CITATION_REWARD_AMOUNT` (e.g., 1 CHOIR = 1_000_000_000).
            *   Get `recipient_address = await get_user_wallet(user_id)`.
            *   If address found, call `await sui_service.mint_choir(recipient_address, CITATION_REWARD_AMOUNT)`.
            *   Log the reward transaction details or errors.
    4.  **User Wallet Mapping:** Implement the `get_user_wallet` function. This likely involves querying the `USERS_COLLECTION` via `DatabaseClient` assuming the user's SUI address is stored there. Update `database.py` (`create_user`, `get_user`) if necessary to include a wallet address field.

### Priority 3: Experience Phase Refactor

*   **Objective:** Modify the Experience phase to deterministically run Qdrant search first, then Web search, and feed results to the LLM for synthesis.
*   **Rationale:** Provides more structured context gathering than relying on LLM tool selection.
*   **Diagram:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant EP as run_experience_phase
        participant LU as Langchain Utils
        participant DB as DatabaseClient
        participant WS as WebSearchTool
        participant LLM as post_llm

        EP->>LU: get_embedding(qdrant_query)
        LU-->>EP: query_vector
        EP->>DB: search_similar(query_vector)
        DB-->>EP: qdrant_results
        EP->>WS: arun(web_query)
        WS-->>EP: web_results_str
        EP->>EP: Format qdrant_results & web_results
        EP->>LLM: Invoke with Action Response + Formatted Results
        LLM-->>EP: experience_response (AIMessage)
        EP-->>WF: ExperiencePhaseOutput(experience_response, web_results, vector_results)

    ```
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `run_experience_phase` (`langchain_workflow.py`):**
        *   Remove the `tools` parameter from the `post_llm` call. Remove the tool execution loop.
        *   Instantiate `DatabaseClient` and `BraveSearchTool` (or preferred web tool).
        *   **Qdrant Search:**
            *   Determine the query text (e.g., from `last_user_msg.content`).
            *   Call `get_embedding` to get the vector.
            *   Call `await db_client.search_similar(...)` using the vector. Store the results (`vector_results`).
        *   **Web Search:**
            *   Determine the query text.
            *   Call `await web_search_tool.arun(...)`. Store the results (`web_results`). Parse if necessary (e.g., if JSON).
        *   **LLM Synthesis:**
            *   Update the `EXPERIENCE_INSTRUCTION` prompt to instruct the LLM to synthesize the `Initial Action Response` using the *provided* Qdrant and Web search results.
            *   Format the `vector_results` and `web_results` into a readable string format.
            *   Inject the formatted results into the message list passed to the *single* `post_llm` call for this phase.
            *   Ensure the `ExperiencePhaseOutput` object is populated correctly with the `experience_response` and the structured `web_results` and `vector_results` lists.

### Priority 4: Hypergraph Integration

*   **Objective:** Use `hypernetx` library to create, update, and utilize hypergraphs representing user context (Intention phase) and thread context (Observation phase).
*   **Rationale:** Provides a structured way to capture and reason about complex relationships and concepts within the conversation.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Dependency:** Add `hypernetx` to `api/requirements.txt`.
    2.  **Hypergraph Manager:**
        *   Create a new file, e.g., `api/app/hypergraph_manager.py`.
        *   Implement a class `HypergraphManager` with methods like:
            *   `__init__(self, graph_id: str, storage_path: str = "/path/to/graphs")`: Loads graph if exists, else creates new. `graph_id` could be `user:<user_id>` or `thread:<thread_id>`.
            *   `load()`: Loads graph from storage (e.g., Pickle file, JSON).
            *   `save()`: Saves graph to storage.
            *   `add_node(node_id, attributes=None)`.
            *   `add_edge(edge_id, nodes, attributes=None)`.
            *   `get_text_representation() -> str`: Generates a summary string for LLM prompts.
            *   `update_from_llm_suggestions(suggestions: str)`: Parses LLM output to add nodes/edges (requires careful prompting and parsing).
    3.  **Intention Phase (`run_intention_phase` in `langchain_workflow.py`):**
        *   Instantiate `manager = HypergraphManager(f"user:{user_id}")`.
        *   Get `graph_text = manager.get_text_representation()`.
        *   Modify `INTENTION_INSTRUCTION` prompt: Include `graph_text` and ask the LLM to identify the user's intention *and* suggest updates (new concepts as nodes, relationships as edges) to the user's hypergraph based on the conversation.
        *   After the `post_llm` call, parse the `response.content` for suggested updates.
        *   Call `manager.update_from_llm_suggestions(parsed_suggestions)`.
        *   Call `manager.save()`.
    4.  **Observation Phase (`run_observation_phase` in `langchain_workflow.py`):**
        *   Instantiate `manager = HypergraphManager(f"thread:{thread_id}")`.
        *   Get `graph_text = manager.get_text_representation()`.
        *   Modify `OBSERVATION_INSTRUCTION` prompt: Include `graph_text` and ask the LLM to identify key concepts/entities from the *current turn* and suggest new nodes/edges representing their connections within the thread context.
        *   After the `post_llm` call, parse suggestions.
        *   Call `manager.update_from_llm_suggestions(parsed_suggestions)`.
        *   Call `manager.save()`.

### Priority 5: Client Model Configuration

*   **Objective:** Allow the SwiftUI client to specify the desired LLM provider and model name for the Postchain workflow via the API.
*   **Rationale:** Provides user flexibility and allows leveraging different model capabilities.
*   **Implementation Steps (Backend):**
    1.  **API Router (`routers/postchain.py`):**
        *   Modify `SimplePostChainRequest` model to include:
            ```python
            model_identifier: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Optional model identifier (e.g., 'anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-latest', 'openrouter/google/gemini-flash-1.5')")
            ```
        *   In the `/langchain` endpoint function, extract `request.model_identifier`.
        *   Pass `model_identifier` to the `run_langchain_postchain_workflow` call.
    2.  **Workflow (`langchain_workflow.py`):**
        *   Modify `run_langchain_postchain_workflow` signature to accept `model_identifier: Optional[str] = None`.
        *   Inside the function, determine the `ModelConfig` to use for *all* phases:
            *   If `model_identifier` is provided, parse it using `get_model_provider` from `langchain_utils.py` to create the `ModelConfig`.
            *   If not provided, fall back to default models defined in `Config` (e.g., `config.CHAT_MODEL`).
        *   Pass this single determined `ModelConfig` to each phase function (`run_action_phase(..., model_config=determined_mc)` etc.).
        *   Remove the per-phase `*_mc_override` parameters from the workflow signature (unless specifically needed for internal testing).
*   **Implementation Steps (Frontend - High Level):**
    1.  **UI:** Add controls (e.g., `Picker` or `Menu`) in SwiftUI views (`PostchainView.swift` or settings view) to select provider/model. Fetch available models from a new API endpoint if needed.
    2.  **ViewModel (`PostchainViewModel.swift`):** Add `@Published` properties to store the user's selection.
    3.  **API Client (`RESTPostchainAPIClient.swift`):** Modify the function that calls `/api/postchain/langchain` to include the selected `model_identifier` in the request body.
