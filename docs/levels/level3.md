# Anonymity by Default: A Core Principle of Choir

VERSION anonymity_by_default: 7.0

Anonymity is not just a feature of Choir; it's a fundamental principle, a design choice that shapes the platform's architecture and informs its values. By making anonymity the default state for all users, Choir prioritizes privacy, freedom of expression, and the creation of a space where ideas are judged on their merits, not on the identity of their author.

**Core Tenets:**

1. **Privacy as a Fundamental Right:** Choir recognizes that privacy is a fundamental human right, essential for individual autonomy and freedom of thought. Anonymity protects users from surveillance, discrimination, and the potential chilling effects of being constantly identified and tracked online.
2. **Freedom of Expression:** Anonymity fosters a space where users can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or reprisal. This is particularly important for discussing sensitive topics, challenging প্রচলিত norms, or exploring unconventional ideas.
3. **Focus on Ideas, Not Identities:** By separating ideas from their authors, anonymity encourages users to evaluate contributions based on their intrinsic value, rather than on the reputation or status of the contributor. This promotes a more meritocratic and intellectually rigorous environment.
4. **Protection from Bias:** Anonymity can help to mitigate the effects of unconscious bias, such as those based on gender, race, or other personal characteristics. It allows ideas to be judged on their own merits, rather than through the lens of preconceived notions about the author.
5. **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Anonymity makes it easier for new users to join the platform and start contributing, as they don't need to go through a complex verification process or share personal information.

**How Anonymity Works on Choir:**

- **Default State:** All users are anonymous by default upon joining the platform. They can interact, contribute content, and earn CHIP tokens without revealing their real-world identity.
- **Unique Identifiers:** Users are assigned unique, randomly generated identifiers that allow them to build a consistent presence on the platform without compromising their anonymity.
- **No Personal Data Collection:** Choir does not collect or store any personally identifiable information about anonymous users.
- **"Priors" and Anonymity:** The "priors" system, which shows the lineage of ideas, maintains anonymity by design. It reveals the connections between ideas, not the identities of the individuals who proposed them.

**Balancing Anonymity with Accountability:**

- **CHIP Staking:** The requirement to stake CHIP tokens to post new messages acts as a deterrent against spam and malicious behavior, even for anonymous users.
- **Community Moderation:** The platform relies on community moderation to maintain the quality of discourse and address any issues that arise.
- **Reputation Systems:** While users are anonymous by default, they can still build reputations based on the quality of their contributions, as tracked through the "priors" system and potentially through community ratings.

**The Value of Anonymity in a High-Information Environment:**

- **Encourages Honest Discourse:** Anonymity can encourage more honest and open discussions, particularly on sensitive or controversial topics.
- **Promotes Intellectual Risk-Taking:** Users may be more willing to take intellectual risks and explore unconventional ideas when they are not worried about the potential repercussions for their personal or professional lives.
- **Facilitates Whistleblowing and Dissent:** Anonymity can provide a safe space for whistleblowers and those who wish to express dissenting views without fear of retaliation.
- **Protects Vulnerable Users:** Anonymity can be particularly important for users in marginalized or vulnerable communities who may face risks if their identities are revealed.

**Conclusion:**

Anonymity by default is a core design principle of Choir, one that reflects the platform's commitment to privacy, freedom of expression, and the creation of a truly meritocratic space for the exchange of ideas. It's a bold choice in a world where online platforms increasingly demand real-name identification, but it's a choice that has the potential to unlock new levels of creativity, honesty, and collective intelligence. By prioritizing anonymity, Choir is not just building a platform; it's building a new model for online interaction, one that empowers individuals and fosters a more open and equitable exchange of ideas.

This document will be integrated into **Level 1: Basic Mechanics**, as it describes a fundamental aspect of how users interact with the platform and each other. It also connects to **Level 3: Value Creation**, as anonymity is a key value proposition for many users, particularly those concerned about privacy and freedom of expression.

# Identity as a Service (IDaaS)

VERSION identity_service: 7.1

Identity on Choir is optional yet valuable. By default, users can participate anonymously, preserving privacy and free expression. However, those who opt into KYC-based verification unlock the ability to participate in binding governance decisions, operate Social AI (SAI) agents under their account, and gain additional social trust signals. This document explains how Identity as a Service (IDaaS) fits into the Choir platform.

---

## Overview

Traditional online platforms typically force users to accept a real-name policy or harvest personal data without explicit consent. Choir takes a different stance:

• **Default Anonymity**: Everyone can read messages, post anonymously, and earn CHIP tokens without providing personal data.
• **Paid Identity**: Those requiring the social or governance benefits of verified status can pay for IDaaS, enabling official KYC-based identity on the platform.

The result is a tiered approach that preserves anonymity for casual or privacy-conscious users, while offering valuable identity features to those who want or need them.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Anonymity First**: No user is required to reveal their personal information to use the basic features of Choir.
2. **Paid Identity**: Identity verification introduces real-world accountability and signals commitment to the community.
3. **Signaling, Not Pay-to-Win**: Verified status does not grant better content visibility—it grants governance participation, the ability to run SAIs, and optional social credibility.
4. **Jurisdictional Compliance**: KYC standards vary globally, so IDaaS is flexible enough to accommodate region-specific regulations.
5. **Privacy Respect**: Despite verification, Choir stores personally identifying information offline and only retains essential proofs on-chain.

---

## Benefits of Verified Identity

- **Governance Participation**: Only verified users can submit binding on-chain votes in futarchy or other proposals.
- **SAI Operator Verification**: KYC ensures that an AI-driven account is mapped to a real individual for accountability.
- **Jurisdictional Compliance**: Verification aligns Choir with relevant regulations, which is critical for the platform’s long-term viability.

Additionally, verified accounts may enjoy intangible benefits like higher reputational trust within the community, though this is a social dynamic rather than a platform-engineered outcome.

---

## IDaaS Workflow

1. **Voluntary Enrollment**: You choose if/when to enroll in IDaaS.
2. **KYC Process**: Provide a government-issued ID or other documentation; a third-party service verifies authenticity.
3. **On-Chain Confirmation**: A non-reversible cryptographic link is posted on-chain (no personally identifying information, just proof of verification).
4. **Subscription or One-Time Fee**: Payment for IDaaS can be structured as recurring or one-time.
5. **Privileges Granted**: The verified user can now vote in binding governance proposals, run SAI agents, and optionally display a verified badge or signal in UI.

---

## Use Cases

- **Governance**: Ensuring that major decisions are made by real individuals with accountability.
- **SAI Execution**: Operating advanced AI software that can influence the platform, under the direct responsibility of a verified user.
- **Enterprise Collaboration**: In corporate settings, having verified internal team members fosters trust and ensures compliance with company or legal requirements.

---

## Monetization and Sustainability

Because IDaaS revenues support the system’s operational costs, they help offset free-tier usage by anonymous participants. This aligns the business model, ensuring that those who need additional capabilities also help fund the platform’s continued growth and stability.

---

## Conclusion

By offering Identity as a Service, Choir establishes a nuanced balance: anonymity remains a core value and default, while verified identity is treated as a premium feature. This approach ensures that governance decisions are accountable, advanced AI operations remain traceable to real individuals, and the platform remains compliant with jurisdictional regulations. Through IDaaS, Choir invites each user to choose the identity model that suits their needs, forging a new path forward for responsible digital communities.

# libSQL Integration Plan for Choir

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating libSQL/Turso as the local persistence layer for the Choir application. This system will provide both offline functionality and synchronization with our global vector database infrastructure, while supporting the FQAHO model parameters and Post Chain architecture.

## Core Objectives

1. Implement libSQL as the primary local persistence solution
2. Design a flexible schema that can accommodate evolving data models
3. Implement vector search capabilities to support semantic matching in the Experience phase
4. Create a synchronization system between local and global databases
5. Support the FQAHO model parameters (α, K₀, m) in the database schema
6. Enable offline functionality with seamless online synchronization

## Implementation Philosophy

Our approach to database implementation will be guided by these principles:

1. **Core System First** - Focus on getting the core UX and system operational before fully committing to a database schema
2. **Flexibility** - Design the database to be adaptable as our data model evolves
3. **Incremental Implementation** - Add database features in phases, starting with the most essential components
4. **Performance** - Optimize for mobile device constraints and offline-first operation

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Setup and Initialization

```swift
import Libsql

class DatabaseService {
    static let shared = try! DatabaseService()

    private let database: Database
    private let connection: Connection

    private init() throws {
        // Get path to document directory for local database
        let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!
        let dbPath = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent("choir.db").path

        // Initialize database with sync capabilities
        self.database = try Database(
            path: dbPath,
            url: Environment.tursoDbUrl,      // Remote database URL
            authToken: Environment.tursoToken, // Authentication token
            syncInterval: 10000               // Sync every 10 seconds
        )

        self.connection = try database.connect()

        // Initialize schema
        try setupSchema()
    }

    private func setupSchema() throws {
        try connection.execute("""

            );

            -- Vector index for similarity search in Experience phase
            CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS messages_embedding_idx
            ON messages(libsql_vector_idx(embedding));

            -- Parameter history for FQAHO model tracking
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parameter_history (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

```

### 2. Thread and Message Operations

```swift

    // MARK: - Thread Operations

    func createThread(id: String, title: String, k0: Double, alpha: Double, m: Double) throws {
        let now = Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970)

            approvalStatus: result["approval_status"] as! String
        )
    }
}
```

### 3. Vector Search for Experience Phase

```swift
extension DatabaseService {
    // Find semantically similar messages for the Experience phase
    func findSimilarExperiences(threadId: String, queryEmbedding: [Float], limit: Int = 5) throws -> [Message] {
        let vectorString = "vector32('\(queryEmbedding)')"

        let results = try connection.query("""

            FROM vector_top_k('messages_embedding_idx', \(vectorString), ?) as v
            JOIN messages m ON m.rowid = v.id
            WHERE m.thread_id = ?
            AND m.approval_status = 'approved'
        """, [limit, threadId])

        return results.map { result in
            Message(
                id: result["id"] as! String,
                threadId: result["thread_id"] as! String,
                userId: result["user_id"] as! String,
                content: result["content"] as! String,

                approvalStatus: result["approval_status"] as! String
            )
        }
    }

    // Get experiences with prior parameter values (for display in Experience step)
    func getExperiencesWithPriors(threadId: String, limit: Int = 10) throws -> [(Message, ParameterSet)] {
        let results = try connection.query("""
            SELECT m.*, p.k0, p.alpha, p.m
            FROM messages m

            )

            return (message, parameters)
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Synchronization Management

```swift
extension DatabaseService {
    // Trigger manual sync with remote database
    func syncWithRemote() throws {
        try database.sync()
    }

    // Check if a sync is needed
    var needsSync: Bool {
        // Implementation depends on how we track local changes
        // Could check for pending operations or time since last sync
        return true
    }

    // Handle network status changes
    func handleNetworkStatusChange(isOnline: Bool) {
        if isOnline && needsSync {
            do {
                try syncWithRemote()
            } catch {
                print("Sync error: \(error)")
                // Handle sync failure
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. FQAHO Parameter Calculation Functions

```swift
extension DatabaseService {
    // Calculate new K₀ value based on approval/refusal
    private func calculateNewK0(currentK0: Double, approvalStatus: String) -> Double {
        // Implementation of FQAHO model K₀ adjustment
        let adjustment: Double = approvalStatus == "approved" ? 0.05 : -0.08
        return max(0.1, min(10.0, currentK0 + adjustment))
    }

    // Calculate new α value based on approval/refusal
    private func calculateNewAlpha(currentAlpha: Double, approvalStatus: String) -> Double {
        // Implementation of FQAHO model α adjustment
        // Fractional parameter capturing memory effects
        let adjustment: Double = approvalStatus == "approved" ? 0.02 : -0.03
        return max(0.1, min(2.0, currentAlpha + adjustment))
    }

    // Calculate new m value based on approval/refusal
    private func calculateNewM(currentM: Double, approvalStatus: String) -> Double {
        // Implementation of FQAHO model m adjustment
        let adjustment: Double = approvalStatus == "approved" ? -0.01 : 0.02
        return max(0.5, min(5.0, currentM + adjustment))
    }
}
```

## Phased Implementation Approach

Given that UX has more pressing issues and the data model is still evolving, we'll adopt a phased approach to database implementation:

### Phase 1: Core UX Development (Current Focus)

- Continue developing the core UI and interaction flow
- Prioritize UX improvements over database implementation
- Use in-memory or mock data for testing

### Phase 2: Schema Development and Validation

- Finalize initial schema design as the core system stabilizes
- Create prototypes to validate the schema with real usage patterns
- Ensure the schema can adapt to evolving requirements

### Phase 3: Basic Database Implementation

- Implement basic CRUD operations for threads and messages
- Set up the database connection and initialization
- Create simplified data services for the UI to consume

### Phase 4: Vector Search Implementation

- Add vector embedding storage and search
- Connect the Experience phase to vector similarity search
- Optimize for performance and memory usage

### Phase 5: FQAHO Parameter Support

- Implement parameter storage and history tracking
- Add parameter calculation algorithms
- Connect parameter adjustments to the UI

### Phase 6: Synchronization

- Configure embedded replicas
- Implement sync management
- Handle offline/online transitions

## Integration with Post Chain Phases

The libSQL implementation will support all phases of the Post Chain:

1. **Action** - Store user messages and initial parameters
2. **Experience** - Use vector search to find relevant prior experiences
3. **Understanding** - Track message reactions and parameter adjustments
4. **Web Search** - Store search results with vector embeddings for future reference
5. **Tool Use** - Record tool usage patterns and outcomes

## Flexible Schema Design Principles

Since the data model is still evolving, the database schema should follow these principles:

1. **Versioned Schema** - Include version markers in the schema to facilitate future migrations
2. **Nullable Fields** - Use nullable fields where appropriate to accommodate evolving requirements
3. **Isolated Tables** - Keep related concepts in separate tables to minimize the impact of changes
4. **Extensible Records** - Consider using a JSON or blob field for attributes that might change frequently
5. **Minimal Dependencies** - Limit foreign key constraints to essential relationships

## Future Considerations

1. **Multi-device Sync**

   - Ensure consistent user experience across devices
   - Handle conflict resolution

2. **Advanced Vector Quantization**

   - Implement quantization for more efficient storage
   - Optimize for mobile device constraints

3. **Partitioned User Databases**

   - Implement per-user database isolation
   - Support multi-tenancy within the app

4. **Backup and Recovery**

   - Implement regular backup mechanisms
   - Create recovery procedures

5. **Extensions for Multimodal Support**
   - Extend schema for image and audio data
   - Implement multimodal vector embeddings
