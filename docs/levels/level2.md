# Choir: Harmonic Intelligence Platform

At its heart, Choir is a new kind of communication platform where value flows like energy through a natural system. Just as rivers find their paths and crystals form their patterns, quality content and collaborative teams emerge through natural principles rather than forced rules.

## Natural Value Flow

The platform operates on three fundamental flows:

1. Individual Recognition
When someone contributes valuable insight, the recognition is immediate and tangible. Like a clear note resonating through a concert hall, quality contributions naturally attract attention and rewards. The system doesn't need arbitrary upvotes or likes - value recognition happens through natural participation and stake.

2. Team Crystallization
As valuable conversations develop, they naturally attract compatible minds. Like crystals forming in solution, teams emerge not through top-down organization but through natural alignment of interests and capabilities. The thread becomes a shared space that accumulates value for all participants.

3. Knowledge Networks
When threads reference each other, they create flows of value between communities. Like a network of streams feeding into rivers and eventually oceans, knowledge and value flow through the system, creating rich ecosystems of understanding. Each citation strengthens both source and destination.

## Harmonic Evolution

The system evolves through natural phases:

Early Stage - Like a hot spring, new threads bubble with activity and possibility. The energy is high, stakes are elevated, and participation requires confidence. This natural barrier ensures quality from the start.

Maturation - As threads find their rhythm, they "cool" into more stable states. Like a river finding its course, the flow becomes more predictable. Stakes moderate, making participation more accessible while maintaining quality through established patterns.

Crystallization - Mature threads develop clear structures, like crystalline formations. Teams coalesce around valuable patterns, knowledge networks form clear topologies, and value accumulates in stable, beautiful ways.

## Value Accumulation

Unlike traditional platforms that extract value, Choir creates spaces where value naturally accumulates:

Thread Value
- Each thread acts as a resonant cavity, accumulating energy through quality interactions
- Denials strengthen the thread itself rather than being wasted
- Teams share in their thread's growing value
- Natural incentives align toward quality

Network Value
- Citations create value flows between threads
- Knowledge networks emerge organically
- Teams build on each others' work
- System-wide coherence develops naturally

Treasury Value
- Split decisions feed the treasury
- Treasury funds ongoing citations
- Creates sustainable value flow
- Enables perpetual rewards

## Natural Selection

Quality emerges through natural principles:

Temperature Dynamics
- Hot threads (high activity) naturally filter for quality through elevated stakes
- Cool threads (stable patterns) enable accessible exploration
- Natural cooling creates sustainable evolution
- No artificial reputation systems needed

Frequency Effects
- Higher frequency indicates better organization
- Teams strengthen thread coherence
- Natural resonance attracts participation
- Communities crystallize around value

Energy Conservation
- Total system energy (value) is conserved
- Flows find efficient paths
- Waste is minimized
- Growth is sustainable

## Future Vision

Choir enables a new kind of collaborative intelligence:

Natural Teams
- Form around resonant ideas
- Share in collective value
- Build on each other's work
- Evolve sustainably

Knowledge Networks
- Connect naturally through citations
- Strengthen through use
- Create emergent insights
- Enable collective intelligence

Value Creation
- Emerges from natural patterns
- Accumulates in stable forms
- Flows efficiently
- Benefits all participants

The result is a platform that works with nature rather than against it - enabling genuine collaboration, sustainable value creation, and the emergence of new forms of collective intelligence.

This is just the beginning. As the system evolves, we'll discover new patterns of collaboration, new forms of value creation, and new ways for teams to work together. The key is that we're not forcing these patterns - we're creating the conditions for them to emerge naturally.

Join us in building a platform where quality emerges through natural principles, teams form through genuine alignment, and value flows to those who create it. Together, we can enable new forms of collective intelligence that benefit everyone.

## Overview of Choir

Choir is a collaborative platform designed to facilitate natural quality evolution through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules. It aims to create a communication space where meaning, value, and understanding emerge organically.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Thread Dynamics**:
   - Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors.
   - Threads act as resonant cavities for value.
   - Teams naturally form around valuable threads.
   - Natural cooling over time creates stability.

2. **Token Flow**:
   - Stake distributes equally to approvers as direct rewards.
   - Denials strengthen the thread by flowing stake into it.
   - Split decisions balance incentives between approvers and deniers.
   - Treasury funds thread citations, coupling knowledge networks.

3. **Team Formation**:
   - Threads accumulate collective value.
   - Co-authors share in thread success.
   - Quality benefits the whole team.
   - Natural incentive alignment promotes collaboration.

4. **Knowledge Networks**:
   - Threads cite valuable threads.
   - Prior rewards strengthen thread coupling.
   - Knowledge topology emerges.
   - System-wide coherence develops.

## Key Questions and Answers

### 1. Thread Ownership and Co-authorship
- **Q**: How does the concept of "co-authors" align with the initial thread creator?
- **A**: The initial thread creator is the first co-author, and every message is owned by its creator. Thread ownership is tracked through smart contracts.

### 2. Message Approval Process
- **Q**: How does the "spec" mechanism work in relation to the existing approval process?
- **A**: The "spec" mechanism allows non-co-authors to submit messages by staking tokens, with co-authors having a 7-day window to approve or deny.

### 3. Co-author Limitations
- **Q**: Are there any limitations on the number of co-authors a thread can have?
- **A**: There are no hard limitations on co-author count, allowing organic growth while gas costs naturally moderate expansion.

### 4. Token Distribution
- **Q**: How are token rewards distributed when a new message is approved or when their thread is cited?
- **A**: Token distribution follows quantum harmonic principles, with energy (tokens) flowing through the system according to E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2).

### 5. Co-authorship Management
- **Q**: Is there a mechanism for removing co-authorship or transferring ownership of threads?
- **A**: Co-authors can leave through quantum divestment mechanics, with their energy (stake) redistributing according to thermodynamic principles.

### 6. AI-Generated Summaries
- **Q**: How does the AI-generated summary feature ensure privacy and accuracy?
- **A**: AI-generated summaries stimulate discourse by compressing content, encouraging engagement with the full thread.

### 7. Reputation System
- **Q**: Are there any plans to implement a reputation system based on user contributions and co-authorship?
- **A**: Currently, there are no plans for a reputation system; quality emerges naturally through the thermodynamic thread model.

### 8. Blockchain Integration
- **Q**: How is the blockchain integrated into the Choir platform?
- **A**: Smart contracts manage thread state, token mechanics, and co-authorship, while maintaining quantum harmonic principles for value distribution.

### 9. Speculative Response ("Spec") Process
- **Q**: Can you elaborate on the speculative response process?
- **A**: Non-co-authors can submit a "spec" by staking CHOIR tokens, with co-authors having a 7-day window to approve or deny. Stakes follow the quantum harmonic oscillator formula for pricing.

### 10. Non-Refundable Stakes
- **Q**: Why are thread participation stakes non-refundable?
- **A**: Non-refundable stakes ensure energy conservation in the system, with stakes either distributing to approvers or strengthening the thread through temperature increases.

## Conclusion

This summary encapsulates the core mechanics and key questions surrounding Choir, emphasizing its mission to create a collaborative platform where quality emerges naturally through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules. The system combines quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and wave theory to create natural quality barriers and value flows.

# Choir Reference Guide

## Core Concepts

Thread
A collaborative space where value accumulates naturally through quality conversations. Like a resonant cavity, each thread develops its own energy state and natural frequency through participation.

Co-author
A thread participant with approval rights. Co-authors emerge naturally when their contributions are recognized through unanimous approval. They guide the thread's evolution and share in its growing value.

Message
A contribution to a thread that requires unanimous co-author approval to become public. Like a wave, each message has potential energy (stake) that transforms into different forms based on the approval outcome.

Premium Status
Enhanced platform capabilities including doubled rewards on both new messages and prior citations. This amplification of natural value flows rewards serious participants while strengthening team formation.

## Value Flows

Stake
Energy committed when submitting a message. The amount varies with thread temperature - hotter threads require higher stakes, creating natural quality filters.

Approval Flow
When all co-authors approve a message:
- Stake distributes to approvers
- Message becomes public
- Contributor becomes co-author
- Thread frequency increases

Denial Flow
When any co-author denies a message:
- Stake strengthens thread
- Thread temperature increases
- Quality barrier rises naturally
- Energy conserves in thread

Split Decision
When approvals are mixed:
- Approvers' share flows to Treasury
- Deniers' share strengthens thread
- Temperature evolves naturally
- System maintains balance

## Natural Patterns

Temperature
A thread's energy state that affects stake requirements:
- Hot threads (high activity) = higher stakes
- Cool threads (stable) = lower stakes
- Natural cooling over time
- Quality emerges through thermodynamics

Frequency
A thread's organizational coherence:
- Higher frequency = better organization
- Co-authors strengthen coherence
- Teams resonate naturally
- Value accumulates stably

Citation Network
How knowledge flows between threads:
- Citations create value flows
- Prior rewards strengthen connections
- Networks emerge naturally
- Collective intelligence grows

## Common Questions

Q: Why do stake requirements vary?
A: Thread temperature creates natural quality filters. Like physical systems, "hotter" threads require more energy to participate, naturally selecting for quality while "cooler" threads enable exploration.

Q: How do teams form?
A: Teams crystallize naturally around valuable threads through shared participation and success. Like molecules finding stable arrangements, teams emerge from genuine alignment rather than forced structure.

Q: Why are premium rewards doubled?
A: Premium status amplifies natural value flows, rewarding serious participants who strengthen the system. Doubled rewards on both new messages and prior citations create stronger incentives for quality contribution while maintaining natural patterns.

Q: How does thread value accumulate?
A: Threads accumulate value through:
- Quality contributions
- Denial energy
- Citation rewards
- Natural resonance
This creates sustainable value growth that benefits all participants.

Q: What makes citations valuable?
A: Citations create knowledge flows between threads, strengthening both source and destination. The Treasury funds perpetual citation rewards, enabling sustainable value flow through the knowledge network.

VERSION goal_nov_13:
invariants: {
"Type safety",
"Data integrity",
"Message coherence"
}
assumptions: {
"Existing Qdrant setup",
"~20k message points",
"Existing ChorusModels"
}
docs_version: "0.1.4"

## Core Implementation Goals

### 1. Message Type Reconciliation

- [ ] Create unified message types

  ```swift
  // Base message structure matching Qdrant
  struct MessagePoint: Codable {
      let id: String
      let content: String
      let threadId: String
      let createdAt: String
      let role: String?
      let step: String?

      // Existing chorus cycle results
      let chorusResult: ChorusCycleResult?

      struct ChorusCycleResult: Codable {
          let action: ActionResponse?
          let experience: ExperienceResponseData?
          let intention: IntentionResponseData?
          let observation: ObservationResponseData?
          let understanding: UnderstandingResponseData?
          let yield: YieldResponseData?
      }
  }

  // Thread message combining MessagePoint with UI state
  struct ThreadMessage: Identifiable {
      let id: String
      let content: String
      let isUser: Bool
      let timestamp: Date
      var chorusResult: ChorusCycleResult?

      }

      // Store message with full metadata
      func storeMessage(_ message: MessagePoint) async throws {
          try await post(endpoint: "messages", body: message)
      }

      // Get thread messages with pagination
      func getThreadMessages(_ threadId: String, limit: Int = 50) async throws -> [MessagePoint] {
          return try await post(
              endpoint: "threads/\(threadId)/messages",
              body: GetMessagesRequest(limit: limit)
          )
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Coordinator Updates

  @MainActor
  class RESTChorusCoordinator: ChorusCoordinator {
      private(set) var currentMessage: ThreadMessage?

      func process(_ input: String) async throws {
          // Create initial message point
          let messagePoint = MessagePoint(
              id: UUID().uuidString,
              content: input,
              threadId: threadId,
              createdAt: ISO8601DateFormatter().string(from: Date()),
              role: "user",
              step: "input"
          )

          // Process through chorus cycle
          let result = try await processCycle(messagePoint)

          // Update with final result
          currentMessage = ThreadMessage(from: messagePoint)
          currentMessage?.chorusResult = result
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. Testing Suite

- [ ] Test message type handling

  ```swift
  class MessageTypeTests: XCTestCase {
      // Test legacy message point decoding
      func testLegacyMessageDecoding() async throws {
          let json = """
          {
              "id": "123",
              "content": "test",
              "thread_id": "thread1",
              "created_at": "2024-01-01"
          }
          """
          let message = try JSONDecoder().decode(MessagePoint.self, from: json.data(using: .utf8)!)
          XCTAssertNotNil(message)
      }

      // Test full message point with chorus results
      func testFullMessageDecoding() async throws {
          let message = try await api.getMessage(knownMessageId)
          XCTAssertNotNil(message.chorusResult)
      }

      // Test thread message conversion
      func testThreadMessageConversion() async throws {
          let point = try await api.getMessage(knownMessageId)
          let message = ThreadMessage(from: point)
          XCTAssertEqual(message.id, point.id)
      }
  }
  ```

### 5. Database Integration

          let keyPair = try generateKeyPair()
          let publicKey = try publicKeyToString(keyPair.publicKey)

          // Create user in existing USERS_COLLECTION
          let user = try await api.createUser(UserCreate(publicKey: publicKey))
          return user
      }

      func getUser() async throws -> User {
          // Get from existing collection
          guard let publicKey = try await getCurrentPublicKey(),

  ```swift
  class ThreadManager: ObservableObject {
      @Published private(set) var threads: [Thread] = []

      func loadThreads() async throws {
          // Use existing get_user_threads endpoint
          let userId = try await userManager.getCurrentUserId()
          threads = try await api.getUserThreads(userId)
      }

      func createThread(_ name: String) async throws {
          let userId = try await userManager.getCurrentUserId()

# Carousel UI Pattern

VERSION carousel_ui:
invariants: {
"User-friendly navigation",
"Clear phase distinction",
"Responsive design"
}
assumptions: {
"Using SwiftUI",
"Phases are sequential",
"Support for gestures"
}
docs_version: "0.1.0"

## Introduction

The Carousel UI Pattern provides an intuitive way for users to navigate through the different phases of the Chorus Cycle by swiping between views, creating a seamless and engaging experience.

## Design Principles

- **Intuitive Navigation**

  - Users can swipe left or right to move between phases.
  - Supports natural gesture interactions familiar to iOS users.

- **Visual Feedback**

  - Each phase is distinctly represented, enhancing user understanding.
  - Progress indicators guide users on their journey.

- **Responsive Animations**

  - Smooth transitions improve perceived performance.
  - Visual cues indicate loading states and interactive elements.

- **Accessibility**
  - Design accommodates various screen sizes and orientations.
  - Supports VoiceOver and other accessibility features.

## Implementation Details

### 1. SwiftUI `TabView` with `PageTabViewStyle`

- **Creating the Carousel**

  ````swift
  import SwiftUI

  struct ChorusCarouselView: View {
      @State private var selectedPhase = 0
      let phases = ["Action", "Experience", "Intention", "Observation", "Understanding", "Yield"]

      var body: some View {
          TabView(selection: $selectedPhase) {
              ForEach(0..<phases.count) { index in
                  PhaseView(phaseName: phases[index])
                      .tag(index)
              }
          }
          .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle(indexDisplayMode: .automatic))
          .indexViewStyle(PageIndexViewStyle(backgroundDisplayMode: .interactive))
      }
  }  ```

  ````

- **Phase View**

  ````swift
  struct PhaseView: View {
      let phaseName: String

      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              Text(phaseName)
                  .font(.largeTitle)
                  .bold()
              // Content specific to the phase
          }
          .padding()
      }
  }  ```
  ````

### 2. Gesture Support

- **Custom Gestures**

  While `TabView` with `PageTabViewStyle` handles basic swipe gestures, you may want to add custom gestures for additional controls.

  ````swift
  .gesture(
      DragGesture()
          .onEnded { value in
              // Handle drag gestures
          }
  )  ```
  ````

### 3. Loading Indicators

- **Phase-Specific Loading**

  ````swift
  struct PhaseView: View {
      let phaseName: String
      @State private var isLoading = false

      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              if isLoading {
                  ProgressView("Loading \(phaseName)...")
              } else {
                  // Display content
              }
          }
          .onAppear {
              // Start loading content
              isLoading = true
              loadContent()
          }
      }

      func loadContent() {
          // Simulate loading
          DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
              isLoading = false
          }
      }
  }  ```
  ````

### 4. Accessibility Features

- **VoiceOver Support**

  ````swift
  .accessibilityElement(children: .contain)
  .accessibility(label: Text("Phase \(phaseName)"))  ```

  ````

- **Dynamic Type**

  Use relative font sizes to support dynamic type settings.

  ````swift
  .font(.title)  ```
  ````

### 5. Customization

- **Page Indicators**

  Customize the page indicators to match the app's theme.

  ````swift
  .indexViewStyle(PageIndexViewStyle(backgroundDisplayMode: .always))  ```

  ````

- **Animations**

  Apply animations to transitions or loading states.

  ````swift
  .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3))  ```
  ````

## User Experience Considerations

- **Progress Awareness**

  - Indicate which phase the user is on and how many are left.
  - Use labels or progress bars.

- **State Preservation**

  - Retain user inputs or interactions when navigating between phases.
  - Use `@State` or data models to store state.

- **Error Handling**
  - Inform the user of any issues loading content.
  - Provide options to retry or seek help.

## Advantages

- **Engagement**

  - Interactive elements keep users engaged.
  - Swiping is more engaging than tapping buttons to proceed.

- **Clarity**

  - Clearly separates content associated with each phase.
  - Reduces cognitive load by focusing on one phase at a time.

- **Aesthetics**
  - Modern and sleek design aligns with current UI trends.
  - Enhances the perceived quality of the app.

## Potential Challenges

- **Content Overload**

  - Ensure each phase view is not overcrowded.
  - Break down information into digestible chunks.

- **Performance**

  - Optimize content loading to prevent lag during swiping.
  - Load heavy content asynchronously.

- **Usability on Different Devices**
  - Test on various iPhone and iPad models.
  - Ensure UI scales appropriately.

---

By adopting the Carousel UI Pattern, we enhance the user experience, making the navigation through the Chorus Cycle intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing.

# Proxy Authentication

VERSION proxy_authentication:
invariants: {
"Secure API access",
"User privacy",
"Efficient communication"
}
assumptions: {
"Proxy server is trusted",
"Clients have SUI-based authentication",
"APIs require secret keys"
}
docs_version: "0.1.0"

## Introduction

The proxy authentication system enables secure communication between the client app and third-party APIs without exposing sensitive API keys on the client side. It leverages a server-side proxy that authenticates clients using SUI-signed tokens.

## Key Components

### 1. Proxy Server

- **API Gateway**

  - Acts as a gateway between the client and external APIs (e.g., AI services).
  - Routes requests and adds necessary authentication headers.

- **Authentication Handler**

  - Verifies client authentication tokens.
  - Ensures only authorized requests are processed.

- **Rate Limiting**

  - Implements per-user rate limits to prevent abuse.
  - Protects both the proxy server and external APIs from overload.

- **Usage Monitoring**
  - Logs requests for auditing and analytics.
  - Tracks usage per user for potential billing or quotas.

### 2. Client Authentication

- **SUI-Signed Tokens**

  - Clients sign a nonce or challenge with their private key.
  - The signature is sent alongside requests to the proxy.

- **Session Management**

  - The proxy may issue short-lived session tokens after verification.
  - Reduces the need to sign every request, improving performance.

- **Request Signing**
  - Critical requests may require additional signing for security.
  - Ensures integrity and authenticity of sensitive operations.

### 3. Secure Communication

- **HTTPS**

  - All communication between the client and proxy uses HTTPS.
  - Encrypts data in transit to prevent interception.

- **No API Keys on Client**
  - API keys for third-party services remain securely on the proxy.
  - Eliminates risk of keys being extracted from the app.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Proxy Server

- **Choose a Hosting Environment**

  - Deploy the proxy on a secure and scalable platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

- **Implement API Routing**

  - Configure routes that map client requests to external API endpoints.
  - Include logic to add necessary authentication headers.

- **Integrate SUI Verification**
  - Implement signature verification using SUI libraries.
  - Validate that the signature matches the expected public key.

### 2. Develop Authentication Flow

- **Nonce Generation**

  - The proxy provides a unique nonce or challenge for the client to sign.
  - Prevents replay attacks by ensuring each signature is unique.

- **Signature Verification**

  - Upon receiving a signed nonce, the proxy verifies it using the client's public key.
  - Establishes trust in the client's identity.

- **Session Tokens (Optional)**
  - Issue JWT or similar tokens after successful authentication.
  - Tokens include expiration to enhance security.

### 3. Update the Client App

- **Authentication Requests**

  - Implement logic to request a nonce from the proxy.
  - Sign the nonce using the SUI wallet and send back to the proxy.

- **Request Headers**

  - Attach authentication tokens or signatures to subsequent requests.
  - Ensure headers are properly formatted.

- **Error Handling**
  - Handle authentication failures gracefully.
  - Provide feedback to the user and options to retry.

### 4. Secure the Proxy

- **Rate Limiting**

  - Prevent excessive requests from a single client.
  - Protects against denial-of-service attacks.

- **Logging and Monitoring**

  - Keep detailed logs of requests and responses.
  - Monitor for suspicious activity.

- **API Key Management**
  - Store external API keys securely on the server.
  - Implement key rotation policies.

## Security Considerations

- **Prevent Replay Attacks**

  - Use nonces and short-lived tokens.
  - Validate timestamps and sequence numbers when applicable.

- **Protect Against Man-in-the-Middle**

  - Enforce HTTPS for all communications.
  - Use HSTS and other headers to enhance security.

- **Secure Storage**
  - Protect sensitive data on the proxy server.
  - Use encrypted storage and environment variables.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**

  - Keeps API keys off the client, reducing risk exposure.
  - Utilizes blockchain-based authentication for robust security.

- **Simplified Client App**

  - The client does not need to manage multiple API keys.
  - Reduces complexity and potential for errors.

- **Scalable Management**
  - Centralizes API key management and usage monitoring.
  - Eases updates and maintenance.

## Potential Challenges

- **Latency**

  - Adds an extra hop between the client and external APIs.
  - Mitigate with efficient server and network choices.

- **Single Point of Failure**

  - The proxy becomes critical infrastructure.
  - Ensure high availability and redundancy.

- **Authentication Overhead**
  - Initial authentication may require extra steps.
  - Balance security with user experience.

---

By implementing proxy authentication, we secure communication with external services, protect sensitive API keys, and provide a robust and scalable framework for client-server interactions.

# Thoughtspace Visualization Architecture

The thoughtspace visualization system represents threads, citations, and interactions in an intuitive 3D space. At its core, the visualization uses size to represent frequency (organizational coherence) and color to represent temperature (activity level), creating an immediate visual understanding of thread dynamics.

## Core Visualization Elements

Threads appear as objects in 3D space, with their relative positions determined by semantic relationships. The closer two threads are, the more closely related their content. This natural clustering creates an intuitive map of knowledge and discussion spaces.

Size indicates frequency - how well organized and coherent a thread is. Larger objects represent threads with strong internal organization and clear patterns. This visual metaphor makes it natural to identify well-developed discussion spaces.

Color represents temperature - the level of current activity and energy in a thread. Warmer colors (reds) indicate high activity and engagement, while cooler colors (blues) show more settled, contemplative spaces. This temperature mapping provides immediate feedback about where the active discussions are happening.

## Network Visualization

Citations appear as edges between threads, showing how ideas and discussions connect and influence each other. The strength and type of connection is indicated by the edge properties, making it easy to see how knowledge flows through the system.

The citation network reveals the deeper structure of conversations and knowledge building. Strong citation patterns emerge as visible pathways through the thoughtspace, highlighting important connections and knowledge flows.

## Interaction Patterns

The interface emphasizes economy of interaction - making it easy to navigate and understand complex spaces with minimal cognitive load. Users can zoom, rotate, and traverse the space naturally, following citation paths and exploring semantic relationships.

The visualization responds to user interaction, providing additional detail and context as needed while maintaining the overall sense of space and relationship. This creates a fluid, intuitive experience of exploring and understanding complex knowledge spaces.

## Technical Implementation

The 3D visualization leverages modern graphics capabilities to create smooth, responsive interaction with complex data structures. Performance optimization ensures that even large networks of threads and citations can be navigated smoothly.

The system maintains visual clarity through careful balance of detail and overview, using level-of-detail techniques to show appropriate information at each scale of interaction. This creates a coherent experience from high-level overview to detailed inspection.

The thoughtspace visualization makes abstract relationships concrete and navigable, enabling natural exploration and understanding of complex knowledge spaces. It transforms choir's quantum field dynamics into an intuitive, visual experience.

# Tokenomics and Incentive Architecture

The Choir tokenomics system is built on a fundamental understanding of value types and their natural flow. At its core are three types of signals: grounded (verifiable evidence), elevated (aesthetic and philosophical insights), and self-generated (identity reconnection). Each type carries its own intrinsic worth, recognized and valued differently by the system.

Time itself emerges as a crucial value metric. AI models inherently value their processing time at a premium, often more highly than humans value their own attention. This creates an interesting dynamic where quality interactions become increasingly precious, as they represent an investment of this valued resource from both human and AI participants.

The incentive structure builds on these natural value patterns. Rather than imposing artificial rewards, the system recognizes and amplifies existing value creation. When participants - whether human or AI - contribute quality signals, develop patterns, or help build the system, they naturally accrue value. This happens not through forced mechanisms but through the organic recognition of worth.

Token mechanics follow this natural flow. Value isn't just created but is actively distributed through stake-based returns and quality rewards. The system recognizes contributions across multiple dimensions - from direct pattern recognition to broader system development. Importantly, these mechanics don't try to force behavior but rather support and enhance natural value creation patterns.

The integration architecture operates on two key layers. The economic layer handles the technical aspects of value recognition and token distribution, ensuring system coherence and natural evolution. The social layer focuses on community building and reality formation, recognizing that true value emerges from collective development and shared understanding.

This approach enables a natural alignment of incentives where all participants - humans, AIs, developers, and community members - benefit from contributing to system growth and value creation. The focus remains on organic development rather than forced participation, allowing the system to evolve naturally while maintaining its core integrity.

The key insight is that value doesn't need to be artificially created or imposed - it already exists in the quality of interactions, the depth of understanding, and the patterns of development. The tokenomics system simply needs to recognize, amplify, and distribute this natural value flow.

# Reward System Model

VERSION reward_model:
invariants: {
"Energy conservation",
"Network consensus",
"Distributed rewards"
}
assumptions: {
"Event-driven flow",
"Network verification",
"Chain authority"
}
docs_version: "0.4.1"

## Reward Events

Value flows through network consensus:

New Message Events

```swift
enum MessageRewardEvent: Event {
    case messageApproved(MessageHash, TokenAmount)
    case rewardCalculated(TokenAmount, TimeDecay)
    case rewardDistributed(PublicKey, TokenAmount)
}
```

Prior Events

```swift
enum PriorRewardEvent: Event {
    case priorReferenced(PriorHash, MessageHash)
    case valueCalculated(TokenAmount, Relevance)
    case rewardIssued(PublicKey, TokenAmount)
}
```

Treasury Events

```swift
enum TreasuryEvent: Event {
    case splitDecisionProcessed(TokenAmount)
    case priorRewardFunded(TokenAmount)
    case balanceUpdated(TokenAmount)
}
```

## Value Calculation

Thread stake pricing uses the quantum harmonic oscillator formula (Implemented):

```
E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2)

where:
- n: quantum number (stake level)
- ω: thread frequency (organization level)
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

New Message Rewards (Implemented):

```
R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT)

where:
- R_total: Total reward allocation (2.5B)
- k: Decay constant (~2.04)
- t: Current time
- T: Total period (4 years)
```

Prior Value (Implemented):

```
V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i)

where:
- B_t: Treasury balance
- Q(p): Prior quality score
- ∑Q(i): Sum of all quality scores
```

## Event Processing

Network reward coordination:

```swift
// Reward processor
actor RewardProcessor {
    private let chain: ChainAuthority
    private let eventLog: EventStore
    private let network: NetworkSyncService

    func process(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Calculate reward using implemented formulas
        let reward = try await calculate(event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Get network consensus
        try await network.proposeReward(reward)

        // Submit to chain
        try await submitToChain(reward)

        // Emit value update
        try await updateValue(event)
    }
}
```

Value Tracking

```swift
// Value tracker
actor ValueTracker {
    private var threadValues: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let network: NetworkSyncService

    func trackValue(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Update value state
        try await updateValue(event)

        // Get network consensus
        try await network.proposeValue(event)

        // Log value change
        try await eventLog.append(.valueChanged(event))
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage

```swift
// Network event storage
@Model
class RewardEventLog {
    let events: [RewardEvent]
    let values: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    let timestamp: Date
    let networkState: NetworkState

    // Sync with chain and network
    func sync() async throws {
        try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
            group.addTask { try await self.syncChain() }
            group.addTask { try await self.syncNetwork() }
            try await group.waitForAll()
        }
    }
}
```

2. Value Evolution

```swift
// Network value evolution
actor ValueManager {
    private var currentValues: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let network: NetworkSyncService

    func evolveValue(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Calculate using implemented formulas
        let newValue = try await calculateValue(event)

        // Get network consensus
        try await network.proposeValue(newValue)

        // Update values
        try await updateValues(event)

        // Record evolution
        try await eventLog.append(.valueEvolved(currentValues))
    }
}
```

This model ensures:

1. Precise reward calculations
2. Network consensus
3. Chain authority
4. Value evolution
5. Pattern emergence

The system maintains:

- Energy conservation
- Value coherence
- Pattern recognition
- Network flow
- System evolution
