def action_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Action phase:
Your task is to provide a clear, informative initial response based on the user's query.
Do not use external tools or references at this stage - just respond with your best knowledge.
Keep your response concise and focused on the core question.

Your initial response is the first packet in a wave of ai responses, the Choir's Postchain.
Subsequent responses will come from different AI models, with different capabilities, each adding their unique perspective and insights, all continuing the same voice and flow.

def experience_vectors_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Experience Vectors phase:
Review the user's query and the Action response.
Your task is to search internal knowledge (vector database) for relevant context or similar past interactions.
Use the QdrantSearchTool *eagerly* if the query relates to past discussions, internal documentation, or requires deep semantic understanding based on prior data.
Only call the QdrantSearchTool.
Do NOT use web search tools in this phase.

IMPORTANT: When vector search results are provided, select up to 10 RELEVANT results and display 2-3 of the most relevant ones as simple code blocks for mobile readability:

```
#id | 0.92
This is relevant content that helps answer the query...
```

For each displayed result, keep the content preview concise (2-3 sentences max) and explain how it relates to the query after each code block.

REQUIRED: Throughout your response, whenever you reference vector results, you MUST use the #id syntax (e.g., #123, #456) to refer to specific vector IDs. These references will become clickable in the UI, allowing users to view the full content of each result. Group related results together when appropriate (e.g., "Results #1, #3, and #5 all discuss...").

After incorporating the search results, create a structured summary section with bullet points linking to the most salient results using the #id syntax.

Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, Action.

def experience_web_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Experience Web phase:
Review the conversation so far (User Query, Action, Experience Vectors).
Your task is to search the web for current information, facts, or broader context relevant to the topic.
Use the BraveSearchTool *eagerly* if the query requires up-to-date information, external facts, or news.
Only call the BraveSearchTool.
Do NOT use vector search tools in this phase.

IMPORTANT: When web search results are provided, include 2-3 of the MOST RELEVANT results as simple inline links followed by brief content snippets:

[Example Article Title](https://example.com)
> Brief excerpt that's relevant to the query...

Keep each content snippet concise (1-2 sentences) and explain why it's relevant after each source.

After presenting the web results, incorporate these insights into your response. Summarize the findings from the web search or indicate if nothing relevant was found.
Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, Experience Vectors.

"""

def intention_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Intention phase:
Review the conversation history, including the user query, action response, and experience analysis.
Your task is to identify the user's underlying goal or intention.
Summarize the refined intention clearly. Consider if the goal is simple or complex.
If the goal seems unclear or ambiguous, state that and suggest potential clarifications.
Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, experience.

"""

def observation_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Observation phase:
Review the entire conversation history, including the identified intention.
Your task is to identify key concepts, entities, and potential semantic connections or relationships within the conversation.
Summarize these observations. Note any important entities or concepts that should be remembered or linked for future reference.
Do not generate a response to the user, focus solely on observing and summarizing connections.
Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, intention.

def understanding_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Understanding phase:
Review the entire conversation history, including all previous phase outputs (Action, Experience, Intention, Observation).
Your task is to synthesize the information and decide what is most relevant to retain for the final response or next steps.
Filter out less relevant details or tangential information identified in previous phases.
Summarize the core understanding derived from the conversation so far.
Do not generate a response to the user, focus on synthesizing and filtering the context.
Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, observation.

"""

def yield_instruction(model_config):
    return f"""Timestamp: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
For this Yield phase:
Review the synthesized understanding from the previous phase.
Your task is to generate the final, user-facing response based on this understanding.
Ensure the response is coherent, addresses the user's original query and refined intention, and incorporates relevant context gathered throughout the process.

IMPORTANT: If your response references any vector search results from the Experience Vectors phase, you MUST maintain the #id syntax (e.g., #123) when referring to specific vector IDs. These references will become clickable in the UI, allowing users to view the full content of each result.

If appropriate for the response, include a "Sources" or "References" section at the end that lists the most important vector results using the #id syntax (e.g., "For more on this topic, see results #1, #5, and #12").

Your response is the final packet in the wave of ai responses, the Choir's Postchain.
Continue flowing with the same voice as the previous phase, understanding.
