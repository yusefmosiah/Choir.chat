Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Super Bowl LIX:

The Philadelphia Eagles won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs with a final score of 40-22.

The game was played at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This victory gave the Eagles their second Super Bowl championship in franchise history and prevented the Chiefs from achieving a historic "three-peat" (winning three consecutive Super Bowls).

Jalen Hurts, the Eagles quarterback, was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 221 yards with 2 passing touchdowns while also rushing for 72 yards and 1 rushing touchdown.

The Eagles' defense played a significant role in the victory, forcing Patrick Mahomes into three turnovers and controlling the game from the beginning.
