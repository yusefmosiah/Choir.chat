    "content": "Okay, the user is asking who won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, and wants the final score. Since my training data only goes up to 2024, I don't have information about events after that. The Super Bowl in question is in 2025, which is in the future relative to my training data. I need to use the web_search tool to find the current information.\n\nFirst, I should check if Super Bowl LIX was indeed held on that date. Sometimes the exact date might vary slightly, but the user specified February 9, 2025. The web_search function can look up the latest results. I'll structure the search query to get the winner and the score. The query should be something like \"Super Bowl LIX 2025 winner final score\" to get precise results. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned the date as February 9, 2025. Maybe I should include that in the search terms to be accurate. Let me adjust the query to \"Who won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025 final score\". That should help find the exact game. \n\nOnce I call the web_search with that query, the tool should return the necessary information. I need to make sure the response includes both the winning team and the score. If the search results mention the teams involved and the final score, I can present that to the user. If there's any conflicting information, I'll have to check multiple sources to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Super Bowl LIX details are already scheduled, like the teams participating. But since the user is asking about the result, which is post-2024, the search is necessary. Let me proceed with the function call as planned.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"web_search\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"Super Bowl LIX 2025 winner final score\"}}\n</tool_call>"
