```
Who won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025? Include the final score.
```

## Response

```
<think>
Okay, the user is asking who won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, and wants the final score. Let me check the current date. Today is March 7, 2025. The Super Bowl LIX was supposed to take place on February 9, 2025, so that's already happened. But wait, Super Bowl dates are usually in early February, right? But the actual game for the 2024 season (which would be Super Bowl LIX) was in February 2025. However, since today is March 7, 2025, the game has already taken place.

But I don't have information beyond my training data, which cuts off in October 2023. So I need to use the web_search tool to get the latest information. Let me perform a search for "Super Bowl LIX winner and score February 9, 2025". The results should tell me who won and the final score. 

Wait, let me make sure. The user is asking about Super Bowl LIX, which is the 59th edition. The last Super Bowl before my cutoff was Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024, where the Kansas City Chiefs won against the San Francisco 49ers. But the user is asking about the next one, which would be 2025. Since that date has already passed, the tool should find the real result.

Looking at the search results, if the game happened, there should be articles or official NFL sources stating the outcome. Let me check the top results. Suppose the search returns that the Kansas City Chiefs won again, beating the Baltimore Ravens 31-28 in overtime. That would be a plausible outcome, but I need to confirm from the actual search results. Alternatively, maybe another team like the San Francisco 49ers or a different AFC team made it. 

If the search shows that the Chiefs won, then the answer would be the Chiefs with the score. If another team, then adjust accordingly. The key is to use the tool's data to provide the accurate result as of March 2025. Since the current date is March 2025, the information should be available. The assistant's answer must reflect the web_search findings accurately, even if it contradicts prior knowledge.

Since today's date is March 7, 2025, Super Bowl LIX (held on February 9, 2025) has already occurred. I'll use the `web_search` tool to retrieve the latest information.

**Search Query:**
