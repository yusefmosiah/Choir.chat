## Query

```
Who won Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025? Include the final score.
```

## Response

```
I don't have access to real-time information or events that occurred after my training data cutoff, which is generally considered to be around the end of 2021. Therefore, I cannot provide the winner of Super Bowl LIX (2025) or the final score. 

If you're interested in the results of Super Bowl LIX, I recommend checking reliable sports news sources or websites that provide up-to-date information on recent sporting events.
