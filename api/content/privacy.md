# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

At Choir, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data while enabling the learning economy. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you use our conversation-to-publication platform and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

## Data We Collect

### Personal Information
- **Wallet Addresses**: We store your Sui blockchain wallet addresses to associate your contributions with rewards.
- **Device Information**: We collect device tokens for push notifications.

### User Content and Intellectual Property
- **Conversation Data**: The content of your conversations with Choir is stored to provide the service and enable conversation-to-publication workflows.
- **Vector Embeddings**: We create and store vector representations of your contributions to enable the novelty and citation reward systems and knowledge retrieval.
- **Publication Content**: When you choose to publish content through our conversation-to-publication workflow, this content becomes part of the collective knowledge commons while maintaining your intellectual property rights through citation tracking.

## Data Portability and Intellectual Property Control

Choir is designed with user data control and intellectual property rights as priorities:

- **Thread Export/Import**: You can export your conversation threads at any time and import them on other devices. Exported threads are encrypted and protected with biometric authentication or a passcode. This ensures you maintain full control over your intellectual contributions.
- **Wallet Mnemonic Export/Import**: You can securely export your wallet mnemonics (seed phrases) and import them on other devices. These exports are protected with biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID) or a passcode fallback.
- **Publication Rights**: When content is published through our conversation-to-publication workflow, you retain intellectual property rights while enabling citation tracking for ongoing compensation.

This functionality gives you full control over your data and intellectual property, allowing you to maintain ownership of your content, wallet information, and citation rights across devices.

## Blockchain Transactions and Citation Tracking

Please note that transactions on the Sui blockchain are public and immutable. While we do not publish your personal information on the blockchain, your wallet address, transaction details, and citation reward distributions are visible on the public ledger. This transparency ensures fair compensation for intellectual contributions while maintaining anonymity through wallet-based identity.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:
- The right to access, update or delete your information
- The right to rectification
- The right to object
- The right of restriction
- The right to data portability
- The right to withdraw consent

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
