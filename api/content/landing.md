# Choir: Amplify Collective Intelligence

**Human + AI Collaboration on the Blockchain.**

We're building a new kind of platform where ideas resonate, knowledge compounds, and value flows back to the creators. Choir uses a unique **PostChain workflow** (Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Understanding, Yield) where multiple AIs collaborate to refine information.

Built on principles of privacy, user ownership, and a fair token economy powered by the **CHIP token** and the **Sui blockchain**.

Emerging from stealth - join us in building the future.

## Core Concepts

*   **PostChain Workflow:** A multi-stage AI thinking process for nuanced understanding.
*   **CHIP Token Economy:** Earn rewards for novel ideas and salient contributions.
*   **Privacy & Anonymity:** Your ideas matter, not your identity. Interact anonymously by default.
*   **Qdrant Vector Memory:** Advanced semantic memory for rich context and knowledge persistence.
