## Getting Help

Welcome to Choir Support. We're here to help you make the most of your experience with the learning economy platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### What is Choir?
Choir is infrastructure for the learning economy—a platform that transforms conversations into intellectual property. It combines conversation-to-publication workflows with citation economics on the Sui blockchain, where intellectual contribution becomes economic activity.

#### How do I earn rewards?
You earn CHOIR tokens through intellectual contribution:
- **Novelty Rewards**: When you contribute original insights that expand collective knowledge into unexplored semantic territory
- **Citation Rewards**: When your contributions are referenced by others as foundational knowledge, providing ongoing compensation for your intellectual property
- **Quality Rewards**: Through peer recognition and collaborative building rather than viral engagement

### Account & Wallet

#### How do I create a wallet?
Tap the "Wallets" tab and select "Create New Wallet." Follow the prompts to secure your wallet with biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID) or a passcode.

#### How do I secure my wallet?
Your wallet is automatically secured with biometric authentication. We strongly recommend exporting your wallet mnemonic (seed phrase) and storing it in a secure location as a backup.

#### Can I use multiple wallets?
Yes, Choir supports multiple wallets. You can create or import additional wallets and switch between them in the Wallets tab.

### Conversations & Publication

#### How does conversation-to-publication work?
Record conversations about any topic—local community observations, creative interpretations, technical analysis, policy discussions. AI research assistants gather relevant sources and context. Collaborative editing transforms dialogue into citable articles with proper attribution and professional formatting.

#### How do threads work?
Threads are separate conversations that can potentially become intellectual property. Each thread maintains its own context and history, building toward publication-quality content.

#### Can I export my conversations?
Yes, you can export your threads securely. This gives you full control over your intellectual property and allows you to back up your conversations or transfer them to another device.

#### What is the PostChain workflow?
PostChain is Choir's multi-phase AI processing system that analyzes your messages through Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Understanding, and Yield phases. This structured approach enables the generation of publication-quality responses while identifying valuable contributions worthy of citation rewards.

### Intellectual Property & Economics

#### What are CHOIR tokens?
CHOIR is the native token of the learning economy on the Sui blockchain. These tokens represent your intellectual contributions and provide ongoing compensation when your insights prove foundational for others.

#### How are novelty rewards calculated?
Novelty rewards are calculated based on how much your contribution expands collective knowledge into unexplored semantic territory. Sophisticated algorithms measure genuine intellectual contribution rather than engagement optimization.

#### What happens when my content is cited?
When your contributions are referenced in others' work, you receive ongoing citation rewards. This creates genuine intellectual property rights where original insights generate appreciating assets rather than disappearing posts. You can track these in the Transactions tab.

#### How does collaborative ownership work?
Citation economics create shared ownership relationships where collaborative intelligence generates value for all participants. Users benefit from referencing valuable existing content rather than creating isolated takes.
