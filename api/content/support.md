Choir is a revolutionary AI chat platform that rewards you for your intelligence. It combines advanced AI conversation capabilities with a tokenized reward system on the Sui blockchain.

#### How do I earn rewards?
You earn CHOIR tokens in two ways:
- **Novelty Rewards**: When you contribute original ideas and prompts
- **Citation Rewards**: When your content is cited in responses to other users

### Account & Wallet

#### How do I create a wallet?
Tap the "Wallets" tab and select "Create New Wallet." Follow the prompts to secure your wallet with biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID) or a passcode.

#### How do I secure my wallet?
Your wallet is automatically secured with biometric authentication. We strongly recommend exporting your wallet mnemonic (seed phrase) and storing it in a secure location as a backup.

#### Can I use multiple wallets?

### Conversations & Threads

#### How do threads work?
Threads are separate conversations you can create within Choir. Each thread maintains its own context and history.

#### Can I export my conversations?
Yes, you can export your threads securely. This allows you to back up your conversations or transfer them to another device.

#### What is the PostChain workflow?
PostChain is Choir's multi-phase AI processing system that analyzes your messages through Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Understanding, and Yield phases to provide rich, contextual responses.

### Rewards & Transactions

#### What are CHOIR tokens?
CHOIR is the native token of the Choir platform on the Sui blockchain. These tokens represent your contributions to the collective intelligence of the platform.

#### How are novelty rewards calculated?
Novelty rewards are calculated based on how different your contribution is from existing content. The more unique your input, the higher the reward.

#### What happens when my content is cited?
When your content helps inform a response to another user, you receive citation rewards. You can track these in the Transactions tab.
