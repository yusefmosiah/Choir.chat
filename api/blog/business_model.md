# Choir's Blueprint: Truthful Mechanism Design for Social Discourse

## Vision: AI for Social Discourse

Choir is building the first social platform based on mechanism design theory, where AI facilitates meaningful human connections rather than replacing them. Our goal is to create a DSIC (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible) truthful mechanism where authentic expression is the optimal strategy.

## Core Innovation: The Revenue Sequence

**App Subscriptions** → **Relationship/Group Multisig Funds** → **Onchain Finance Agents**

This progression ensures that revenue grows naturally with user engagement and relationship formation, creating sustainable alignment between business success and community value.

## Theoretical Foundation

Choir emerges from deep thinking about mechanism design theory. At its core, we're solving the problem of how to create a social platform where posting creates value rather than liability, treating social media posting as bidding in a Vickrey auction where truthful bidding (authentic expression) is the dominant strategy.

## Three-Phase Revenue Model

### Phase 1: App Subscription Model

**Free Tier (Beta Only):** Core functionality free during beta to validate product-market fit
**Subscription Tiers (Post-Beta):** Exponential price-to-rate-limit ratios covering AI model costs and Sui transaction fees:

*   **Basic ($9/month):** 100 AI conversations, standard processing
*   **Pro ($29/month):** 500 conversations, priority processing, advanced models
*   **Expert ($99/month):** 2000 conversations, fastest processing, premium features
*   **Unlimited ($299/month):** No rate limits, experimental features, dedicated support

**Full Anonymity:** Identity emerges from wallet activity and Sui's nameserver. No KYC or persistent identities required.

### Phase 2: Relationship/Group Multisig Funds

As users form meaningful relationships through staking, these connections become economic entities with shared treasuries that can make collective investment decisions.

### Phase 3: Onchain Finance Agents (Primary Revenue Driver)

**Financial Agent Services:** AI-powered portfolio management, DeFi strategies, cross-chain operations, and tax optimization for relationship/group funds.
**Revenue:** 2-5% transaction fees on all financial operations executed by our AI agents.

### CHOIR Coin Treasury Strategy & Financial Engineering

**Buyback Program:** CHI allocates significant revenue to purchasing CHOIR tokens from the open market, creating sustained buy pressure and aligning corporate success with token value.

**Debt Financing Strategy:** Once recurring revenue is established, CHI can leverage cash flows to take on debt for accelerated CHOIR acquisitions, amplifying returns when tokens appreciate.

**Strategic Rationale:** Corporate success directly tied to CHOIR performance, creating alignment between business growth and token holder value.

## The CHOIR Coin Ecosystem

**Earning CHOIR:**
*   **Novelty Rewards:** Contributing original ideas and perspectives
*   **Citation Rewards:** Having contributions referenced by others
*   **Relationship Value:** Shared appreciation in successful relationship multisigs

**Using CHOIR:**
*   **Relationship Staking:** Invest tokens in meaningful connections with other users
*   **Group Formation:** Pool resources with like-minded individuals for collective decisions
*   **Financial Services:** Access AI-powered portfolio management and DeFi strategies

**Mainnet Status:** CHOIR is live on Sui mainnet with package ID `0x4f83f1cd85aefd0254e5b6f93bd344f49dd434269af698998dd5f4baec612898::choir::CHOIR`.

## Mechanism Design Innovation

**DSIC Social Media:** Choir creates the first social platform where authentic expression is the dominant strategy, solving the fundamental incentive problems of traditional social media.

**Vickrey Auction Analogy:**
*   **Posting = Bidding:** Users contribute their authentic thoughts
*   **Anonymity = Sealed Bids:** Removes social signaling and status games
*   **Citation Rewards = Second-Price Auction:** Value flows based on community recognition, not self-promotion

## Path Forward

1.  **Beta Launch:** Free tier to validate product-market fit and relationship formation
2.  **Subscription Model:** Implement tiered pricing to cover AI and blockchain costs
3.  **Relationship Economy:** Enable group multisigs and collective decision-making
4.  **Financial Services:** Launch AI-powered financial agents for relationship funds

This model represents the first practical implementation of mechanism design theory for social media, creating a sustainable platform where technology serves human flourishing rather than exploiting human psychology.
