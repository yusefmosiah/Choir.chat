# Choir's Blueprint: Learning Economy Infrastructure Through Mechanism Design

## Vision: Infrastructure for Intellectual Contribution

Choir is building the first social platform based on mechanism design theory that serves the learning economy—where intellectual contribution becomes economic activity. Our goal is to create a DSIC (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible) truthful mechanism where authentic expression and genuine insight generation are the optimal strategies for economic success.

## Core Innovation: The Revenue Sequence

**App Subscriptions** → **Relationship/Group Multisig Funds** → **Onchain Finance Agents**

This progression ensures that revenue grows naturally with user engagement and relationship formation, creating sustainable alignment between business success and community value.

## Theoretical Foundation: Learning Economy Meets Mechanism Design

Choir emerges from the intersection of mechanism design theory and learning economy principles. At its core, we're solving the problem of how to create a platform where intellectual contribution creates value rather than liability, treating knowledge sharing as bidding in a Vickrey auction where truthful expression (authentic insight) is the dominant strategy.

The learning economy rewards different capabilities than traditional education: the ability to generate original insights, combine knowledge across disciplines, collaborate with both humans and AI systems, and contribute to collective intelligence. These capabilities cannot be taught through traditional methods because they emerge through practice, iteration, and real contribution to knowledge creation.

## Three-Phase Revenue Model

### Phase 1: App Subscription Model - Learning Economy Access

**Free Tier (Beta Only):** Core conversation-to-publication functionality free during beta to validate learning economy product-market fit
**Subscription Tiers (Post-Beta):** Exponential price-to-rate-limit ratios covering AI model costs, research infrastructure, and Sui transaction fees:

*   **Basic ($9/month):** 100 AI conversations, standard processing, basic citation tracking
*   **Pro ($29/month):** 500 conversations, priority processing, advanced models, enhanced research tools
*   **Expert ($99/month):** 2000 conversations, fastest processing, premium features, cross-disciplinary synthesis tools
*   **Unlimited ($299/month):** No rate limits, experimental features, dedicated support, institutional collaboration tools

**Full Anonymity:** Identity emerges from intellectual contribution patterns and wallet activity. Ideas stand on merit, not credentials. No KYC or persistent identities required.

### Phase 2: Relationship/Group Multisig Funds

As users form meaningful relationships through staking, these connections become economic entities with shared treasuries that can make collective investment decisions.

### Phase 3: Onchain Finance Agents (Primary Revenue Driver)

**Financial Agent Services:** AI-powered portfolio management, DeFi strategies, cross-chain operations, and tax optimization for relationship/group funds.
**Revenue:** 2-5% transaction fees on all financial operations executed by our AI agents.

### CHOIR Coin Treasury Strategy & Financial Engineering

**Buyback Program:** CHI allocates significant revenue to purchasing CHOIR tokens from the open market, creating sustained buy pressure and aligning corporate success with token value.

**Debt Financing Strategy:** Once recurring revenue is established, CHI can leverage cash flows to take on debt for accelerated CHOIR acquisitions, amplifying returns when tokens appreciate.

**Strategic Rationale:** Corporate success directly tied to CHOIR performance, creating alignment between business growth and token holder value.

## The CHOIR Coin Ecosystem

**Earning CHOIR:**
*   **Novelty Rewards:** Contributing original insights that expand collective knowledge into unexplored semantic territory
*   **Citation Rewards:** Having contributions referenced by others as foundational knowledge (ongoing compensation for intellectual property)
*   **Quality Rewards:** Peer recognition and collaborative building rather than viral spread
*   **Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis:** Novel connections between previously separate domains

**Using CHOIR:**
*   **Research Infrastructure Access:** Enhanced AI research assistants and collaborative editing tools
*   **Publication Services:** Transform conversations into citable articles with proper attribution
*   **Relationship Staking:** Invest tokens in meaningful intellectual connections
*   **Group Formation:** Pool resources with like-minded individuals for collective knowledge creation
*   **Financial Services:** Access AI-powered portfolio management for intellectual capital

**Mainnet Status:** CHOIR is live on Sui mainnet with package ID `0x4f83f1cd85aefd0254e5b6f93bd344f49dd434269af698998dd5f4baec612898::choir::CHOIR`.

## Mechanism Design Innovation for the Learning Economy

**DSIC Learning Platform:** Choir creates the first platform where authentic intellectual contribution is the dominant strategy, solving the fundamental incentive problems of both traditional social media and educational systems.

**Learning Economy Vickrey Auction:**
*   **Knowledge Contribution = Bidding:** Users contribute their authentic insights and intellectual labor
*   **Anonymity = Sealed Bids:** Ideas stand on merit, removing credential signaling and institutional bias
*   **Citation Rewards = Second-Price Auction:** Value flows based on intellectual merit and community recognition
*   **Conversation-to-Publication = Value Creation:** Every interaction potentially contributes to collective knowledge commons

## Path Forward: Building Learning Economy Infrastructure

1.  **Beta Launch:** Free tier to validate learning economy product-market fit and intellectual contribution patterns
2.  **Subscription Model:** Implement tiered pricing to cover AI research infrastructure and conversation-to-publication tools
3.  **Intellectual Property Economy:** Enable citation tracking, collaborative ownership, and ongoing compensation for foundational insights
4.  **Institutional Integration:** Partner with educational institutions to transform student work into genuine intellectual contribution
5.  **Research Infrastructure:** Develop proprietary knowledge networks that enhance collaborative intelligence capabilities

This model represents the first practical implementation of mechanism design theory for the learning economy, creating sustainable infrastructure where technology serves intellectual flourishing and genuine knowledge creation rather than exploiting psychological vulnerabilities for attention extraction.
