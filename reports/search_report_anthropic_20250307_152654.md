Based on the search results, there are several notable scientific breakthroughs from late 2024 and early 2025, but a few stand out:

1. Astronomical Breakthrough: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) created the largest 3D map of the universe, measuring universal expansion over 11 billion years.

2. Potential Mars Discovery: Researchers uncovered possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, which could be a groundbreaking finding if confirmed.

3. Medical Advancement: A breakthrough involving the protein Ly6a offered new hope for cancer patients who don't respond to current treatments.

4. AI and Scientific Discovery: There were significant advancements in using AI for scientific research, with the World Economic Forum highlighting AI's role in scientific breakthroughs.

5. Human Cell Atlas: Significant progress was made with 40 new scientific papers published describing detailed cellular mapping.

While it's difficult to definitively state the "most significant" breakthrough, the DESI universe mapping and the potential evidence of ancient life on Mars seem to be particularly noteworthy discoveries that could fundamentally change our understanding of the universe and potential extraterrestrial life.
