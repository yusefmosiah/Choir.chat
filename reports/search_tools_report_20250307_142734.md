This digital brain model required five years of development and runs on a specialized exascale supercomputer.

3. **Error-Corrected Quantum Computer** (February 2025) - IBM researchers developed the first practical error-corrected quantum computer, a major milestone that brings quantum computing closer to mainstream applications.

Earlier breakthroughs from late 2024 included the achievement of "utility scale" quantum computing and a sustained fusion reaction that produced net positive energy for a record 7.8 seconds.

The room-temperature superconductor stands out as particularly significant because it solves a problem scientists have been working on for decades and has immediate practical applications that could transform multiple industries.
